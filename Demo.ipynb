Lenders provide liquidity by depositing\\ncryptocurrencies in a pool contract. Simultaneously, in the same contract, the pooled funds can be borrowed by\\nplacing a collateral. Loans do not need to be individually matched, instead they rely on the pooled funds, as well as\\nthe amounts borrowed and their collateral. This enables instant loans with characteristics based on the state of the\\npool. A simplified scheme of the protocol is presented in figure 1 below.\\nFigure 1: The Aave Protocol\\nThe interest rate for both borrowers and lenders is decided algorithmically:\\n• For borrowers, it depends on the cost of money - the amount of funds available in the pool at a specific time.\\nAs funds are borrowed from the pool, the amount of funds available decreases which raises the interest rate.\\n• For lenders, this interest rate corresponds to the earn rate, with the algorithm safeguarding a liquidity reserve\\nto guarantee withdrawals at any time.\\n1.1\\nBasic Concepts\\nFigure 2: Lending Pool Basics\\nAt the heart of a lending pool is the concept of reserve: every pool holds reserves in multiple currencies, with\\nthe total amount in Ethereum defined as total liquidity. A reserve accepts deposits from lenders. Users can\\nborrow these funds, granted that they lock a greater value as collateral, which backs the borrow position.\\nSpecific currencies in the pooled reserves can be configured as collateral or not for borrow positions, only low risk\\ntokens should be considered. The amount one can borrow depends on the currencies deposited still available in the\\nreserves. Every reserve has a specific Loan-To-Value (LTV), calculated as the weighted average of the different\\nLTVs of the currencies composing the collateral, where the weight for each LTV is the equivalent amount of the\\ncollateral in ETH; figure 3 shows an example of parameters.\\nEvery borrow position can be opened with a stable or variable rate. Borrows have infinite duration, and there is\\nno repayment schedule: partial or full repayments can be made anytime.\\nFigure 3: Lending Pool Parameters\\nIn case of price fluctuations, a borrow position might be liquidated. A liquidation event happens when the price of\\nthe collateral drops below the threshold, LQ, called liquidation threshold. Reaching this ratio channels a liquida-\\ntion bonus, which incentivizes liquidators to buy the collateral at a discounted price. Every reserve has a specific\\nliquidation threshold, following the same approach as for the LTV. Calculation of the average liquidation threshold La\\nQ\\nis performed dynamically, using the weighted average of the liquidation thresholds of the collateral’s underlying assets.\\nAt any point in time, a borrow position is characterized by its health factor Hf, a function for the total col-\\nlateral and the total borrows which determines if a loan is undercollateralized:\\nHf =\\nT otalCollateralET H∗La\\nQ\\nT otalBorrowsET H+T otalF eesET H when Hf < 1, a loan is considered undercollateralized and can be liquidated\\nFurther details on liquidation can be found in section 3.6.\\n1.2\\nFormal Definitions\\nVariable\\nDescription\\nT,\\ncurrent\\ntimes-\\ntamp\\nCurrent number of seconds defined by block.timestamp.\\nTl,\\nlast\\nupdated\\ntimestamp\\nTimestamp of the last update of the reserve data.

Atokens are minted upon deposit,\\ntheir value increases until they are burned on redeem or liquidated. Whenever a user opens a borrow position, the\\ntokens used as collateral are locked and cannot be transferred. Further details on the tokenization are in section 3.8.\\n2.4\\nLending Pool Configurator\\nThe LendingPoolConfigurator provides main configuration functions for LendingPool and LendingPoolCore:\\n• Reserve initialization\\n• Reserve configuration\\n• Enable/disable borrowing on a reserve\\n• Enable/disable the usage of a specific reserve as collateral.\\nThe LendingPoolConfigurator contract will be integrated in Aave Protocol governance.\\n2.5\\nInterest Rate Strategy\\nThe InterestRateStrategy contract holds the information needed to update the interest rates of a specific reserve\\nand implements the update of the interest rates. Every reserve has a specific InterestRateStrategy contract.\\nSpecifically, within the base strategy contract DefaultReserveInterestRateStrategy the following are defined:\\n• Base variable borrow rate Rv0\\n• Interest rate slope below optimal utilisation Rslope1\\n• Interest rate slope beyond optimal utilisation Rslope2\\nThe current variable borrow rate is:\\nRv =\\n(\\nRv0 +\\nU\\nUoptimal Rslope1, if U ≤Uoptimal\\nRv0 + Rslope1 + U−Uoptimal\\n1−Uoptimal Rslope2, if U > Uoptimal\\nThis interest rate model allows for calibration of key interest rates:\\n• At U = 0, Rv = Rv0\\n• At U = Uoptimal, Rv = Rv0 + Rslope1\\n• Above Uoptimal, the interest rate rises sharply to take into account the cost of capital.\\nThe stable borrow rate follows the same model described in section 4.2.\\n2.6\\nGovernance\\nThe rights of the protocol are controlled by the LEND token. Initially, the Aave Protocol will be launched with\\na decentralized on-chain governance based on the DAOStack framework which will evolve to a fully autonomous\\nprotocol. On-chain implies all votes are binding: actions that follow a vote are hard-coded and must be executed.\\nTo understand the scope of the governance it’s important to make the distinction:\\n• The Aave Protocol is bound to evolve and will allow the creation of multiple lending pools with segregated\\nliquidity, parameters, permissions, and type of assets.\\n• The Aave Lending Pool is the first pool of the Aave protocol until the Pool Factory Update is released and\\nanyone can create their own pool.\\nWithin the Aave Protocol, the governance will take place at two level :\\n1. The Protocol’s Governance voting is weighted by LEND for decisions related to protocol parameters and\\nupgrades of the smart contract. It can be compared to MakerDAO’s governance where stakeholders vote on\\ncurrent and future parameters of the protocol.\\n2. The Pool’s Governance where your vote is weighted based on your share of pool liquidity expressed in\\naTokens. The votes cover pool specific parameters such as assets used as collateral or to be borrowed.\\nEach Pool will have its own governance, under the umbrella of the Protocol’s Governance.\\nMore details on the Governance will be published in a Governance Proposal to the community.\\n3\\nThe LendingPool Contract\\nThe actions implemented within LendingPool allow users to interact with the reserve. All the actions follow this\\nspecific sequence:\\nFigure 5: The LendingPool Contract\\n3.1\\nDeposit\\nThe deposit action is the simplest one and does not have any particular state check. The sequence of action is:\\nFigure 6: Deposit funds\\n3.2\\nRedeem\\nThe redeem action allows users to exchange an amount of aTokens for the underlying asset. The actual amount\\nto redeem is calculated using the aToken/underlying exchange rate Ei in section 3.8. The action is defined as follows:\\nFigure 7: Redeem funds\\n3.3\\nBorrow\\nThe borrow action transfers to the user a specific amount of underlying asset, in exchange of a collateral that remains\\nlocked. The flow of action can be described as follows:\\nFigure 8: Borrow funds\\n3.4\\nRepay\\nThe repay action allows the user to repay completely or partially the borrowed amount plus the origination fee and\\nthe accrued interest.\\nFigure 9: Repay a loan\\n3.5\\nSwap Rate\\nThe swap rate action allows a user with a borrow in progress to swap between variable and stable borrow rate.\\nFigure 10: Swap Rate\\n3.6\\nLiquidation Call\\nThe liquidationcall contract allows any external actor to purchase part of a collateral at a discounted price. In\\ncase of a liquidation event, a maximum of 50% of the loan can be liquidated, which will bring the health factor back\\nabove 1.\\nFigure 11: Liquidation\\n3.7\\nFlash Loans\\nThe flash loan action will allow users to borrow from the reserves within a single transaction, as long as the user\\nreturns more liquidity that has been taken.\\nFigure 12: Flash Loan\\nFlash loans temporarily transfer the funds to a smart contract that respects the IFlashLoanEnabledContract.sol\\ninterface. The address of the contract is a parameter of the action. After the funds are transferred, the method\\nexecuteOperation() is executed on the external contract. The contract can do whatever action is needed with the\\nborrowed funds. After the method executeOperation() is completed, a check is performed to verify that the funds\\nplus fee have been returned to the LendingPool contract. The fee is then accrued to the reserve, and the state of\\nthe reserve is updated. If less funds than what was borrowed have been returned to the reserve, the transaction is\\nreverted.\\n3.8\\nTokenization\\nThe Aave protocol implements a tokenization strategy for liquidity providers. Upon deposit, the depositor receives a\\ncorresponding amount of derivative tokens, called Aave Tokens (aTokens for short) that map 1:1 the underlying\\nassets. The balance of aTokens of every depositor grows over time, driven by the perpetual accrual of interest of\\ndeposits. aTokens are fully ERC20 compliant.\\naTokens also natively implement the concept of interest rate redirection. Indeed, the value accrued over time by\\nthe borrowers’ interest rate payments is distinct from the principal value. Once there is a balance of aTokens, the\\naccrued value can be redirected to any address, effectively splitting the balance and the generated interest. We call\\nthe continuous flow of accumulated interest over time the interest stream.\\nTo implement this tokenization strategy, Aave introduced the following concepts in the aToken contract:\\n1. User x balance index It\\nx: Is the value of the reserve normalized income It\\nx at the moment of execution of\\nthe last action by the user.\\n2. Principal balance Bp: Is the balance stored in the balances mapping of the ERC20 aToken contract. The\\nprincipal balance gets updated on every action that the user executes on the aToken contract (deposit, redeem,\\ntransfer, liquidation, interest rate redirection)\\n3. Redirection address Ar: When a user decides to redirect his interest stream to another address, a new\\nredirection address Ar is provided. If no redirection of the interest stream is performed, Ar is 0\\n4. Redirected Balance Bx\\nr : Whenever a user redirects his interest stream, the balance of user redirecting is\\nadded to the redirected balance Br of the address specified by Br. Defined as follows:\\nBx\\nr = P\\nX Bp\\nWhere X is the set of users redirecting the interest stream to the user x\\nThe redirected balance decreases whenever a user x0 ∈X redeems or transfers his aTokens to another user\\nthat is not redirecting to x.\\n5. Current balance Bc: Is the balance returned by the balanceOf() function of the aToken contract. Defined\\nas follows:\\nBx\\nc =\\n0, if Bx\\np = 0 and Bx\\nr = 0\\nBx\\np + Bx\\nr ( In\\nIx −1), if Ar <> 0\\nBx\\np\\nIn\\nIx + Bx\\nr ( In\\nIx −1), if Ar = 0\\n3.8.1\\nLimitations of the tokenization model\\nThe described tokenization model has many advantages compared to the widely used, exchange rate based approach,\\nbut also some drawbacks, specifically:\\n1. It’s impossible to transfer the whole balance at once: Given the perpetual accrual of the interest rate,\\nthere is no way to specify the exact amount to transfer, since the interest will keep accruing even while the\\ntransfer transaction is being confirmed. This means that having exactly 0 balance after a transfer is impossible,\\nrather, a very small balance (dust balance) will be left to the from account executing the transfer. Note that\\nthis could have been avoided by adding specific logic to handle this particular edge case, but this would have\\nmeant adding a non standard behavior to the ERC20 transfer function, and for this reason we avoided it. Even\\nthough this is not a relevant issue, it’s important to note that is possible to completely clear the remaining\\nbalance by either 1. execute another transfer, which will most likely transfer the remaining dust balance as it\\nwould be too small to accrue interest in a reasonably short amount of time, or 2. redeem the dust balance and\\ntransfer the underlying asset.\\n2. Interest stream can only be redirected if there is a principal balance: This means that only accounts\\nthat have a principal balance Bp can redirect their interest. If users redeem or transfer everything, their\\ninterest redirection is reset. As a side effect of this, interest generated only by the redirected balance Br cannot\\nbe redirected.\\n4\\nStable Rate Theory\\nThe following chapter explains how the stable rates are applied to the system and the limitations.\\nImplementation of a fixed rate model on top of a pool is complicated. Indeed, fixed rates are hard to handle\\nalgorithmically, as the cost of borrowing money varies with market conditions and the liquidity available. There\\nmight therefore be situations (sudden market changes, bank runs ...) in which handling stable rate borrow positions\\nwould need using specific heuristics based on time or economical constraints. Following this reasoning, we identified\\ntwo possible ways of handling fixed rates:\\n1. Imposing time constraints: fixed rates might work perfectly fine in a time constrained fashion. If a loan\\nhas a stable duration, it should survive extreme market conditions, as the borrower must repay at the end of\\nthe loan period. Unfortunately, time constrained fixed rate loans aren’t suitable for our specific use case of\\nopen ended loan. It would require a certain degree of UX friction where users would need to create and handle\\nmultiple loans with different times constraints.\\n2. Imposing rates constraints: An interest rate calculated at the beginning of a loan might be impacted by\\nmarket conditions, keeping it from staying fixed. If the rate diverges too much from the market, it can be\\nreadjusted. This would not be a pure fixed rate, open term loan - as the rate might vary throughout the loan\\nduration - yet users will experience actual fixed rates during specific time periods, or when there is enough\\nliquidity available. This particular implementation has been chosen to be integrated into Aave’s Protocol\\nunder the name stable rate.\\n4.1\\nLending Rate Oracle\\nFigure 13: Lending Rate Oracle\\nThe first component to be integrated into the Protocol protocol is a Lending Rate Oracle, which will provide\\ninformation to the contracts on the actual market rates that other lending platforms, both centralized and\\ndecentralized, are providing. The average market lending rate Mr is defined for i platforms with P i\\nr the lending rate\\nand P i\\nv the borrowing volume:\\nMr =\\nPn\\ni=1 P i\\nrP i\\nv\\nPn\\ni=1 P iv\\nThe market rate will be updated daily, initially by Aave.\\n4.2\\nCurrent Stable Borrow Rate Rs\\nThe current stable borrow rate is calculated as follows:\\nRt\\ns =\\n(\\nMr +\\nU\\nUoptimal Rslope1, if U ≤Uoptimal\\nMr + Rslope1 + U−Uoptimal\\n1−Uoptimal Rslope2, if U > Uoptimal\\nWith:\\n- Mr the average market lending rate.\\n- Rslope1 the interest rate slope below Uoptimal, increases the rate as U increases.\\n- Rslope2 the interest rate slope beyond Uoptimal, increases as the difference between U and Uoptimal increases.\\n- U is the utilization rate.\\nNote: Rs does NOT impact existing stable rates positions - this is applied only to new opened positions.\\n4.3\\nLimitations on Stable Rate Positions\\nTo avoid abuses on stable rate loans, the following limitations have been applied to the stable rate borrowing model:\\n1. Users cannot deposit as collateral more liquidity than what they are trying to borrow. Eg. a user deposits 10\\nmillion DAI collateral, tries to borrow 1 million DAI. This is to prevent the following attack vector:\\nGiven: Bs = 18%APR, Mr = 9%APR, Rl = 12%APR\\nUsers might try to artificially lower Bs to the value of Mr by depositing a huge amount of liquidity which\\nwould cause Bs to drop, then borrow from the same liquidity at a lower rate, withdraw the liquidity previously\\ndeposited to cause Bs and the liquidity rate Rl to raise again; then finally deposit the amount borrowed to\\nearn interest on the previously borrowed funds. Although this attack can still be carried out using multiple\\naccounts, this particular constraint makes the attack more complicated as it requires more money (and a\\ndifferent collateral currency). This works well in combination with the interest rate rebalancing in the next\\nsection.\\n2. Borrowers will only be able to borrow up to Tr of the available liquidity at the current borrow rate. So, for\\nevery specific value of Bs, there is only up to Tr of liquidity available for a single borrower. This is to avoid\\nthat a specific borrower would borrow too much available liquidity at a too competitive rate.\\n4.4\\nStable Rate Rebalancing\\nThe last and perhaps most important constraint of the stable rate model is the rate rebalancing. This is to work\\naround changes in market conditions or increased cost of money within the pool.\\nThe stable rate rebalancing will happen in two specific situations:\\n1. Rebalancing up. The stable rate of a user x is rebalanced to the most recent value of Bs when a user could\\nearn interest by borrowing:\\nBx\\ns < Rl with Bx\\ns the stable borrow rate of user x\\n2. Rebalancing down. The stable rate of a user x is rebalanced to the most recent value of Bs, if:\\nBx\\ns > Bs(1 + ∆Bs)\\nwith ∆Bs a rate delta established by governance which defines the window above Bs to rebalance interest\\nrates. If a user pays too much interest beyond that range, the rate is balanced down.\\n4.5\\nThe Rebalancing Process\\nThe LendingPool contract exposes a function rebalanceStableBorrowRate(address reserve, address user)\\nwhich allows to rebalance the stable rate interest of a specific user. Anybody can call this function: however, there\\nisn’t any direct incentive for the caller to rebalance the rate of a specific user. For this reason, Aave will provide\\nan agent that will periodically monitor all the stable rates positions and rebalance the ones that will be deemed\\nnecessary. The rebalance strategy will be decided offchain by the agent, this means that users that satisfy the\\nrebalance conditions may not be rebalanced immediately. Since those conditions depend on the liquidity avail-\\nable and the state of market, there might be some transitory situations in which an immediate rebalance is not needed.\\nThis does not add any element of centralization to the protocol. Even if the agent stops working, anybody can call\\nthe rebalance function of the LendingPool contract. Although there isn’t any direct incentive in doing it (“why\\nshould I do it?”) there is an indirect incentive for the ecosystem. In fact, even if the agent should cease to exist,\\ndepositors might still want to trigger a rebalance up of the lowest borrow rate positions, to increase the liquidity\\nrate and/or force borrowers to close up their positions, increasing the available liquidity. In case of a rescale down,\\ninstead, borrowers have a direct incentive in performing a rebalance of their positions to lower the interest rate.\\nThe following flowchart explains the sequence of actions of the function rebalanceStableBorrowRate().

       "  'text': 'Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\\nSatoshi Nakamoto\\n[EMAIL]\\nwww.bitcoin.org\\nAbstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online\\npayments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a\\nfinancial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main\\nbenefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.\\nWe propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.\\nThe network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of\\nhash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing\\nthe proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of\\nevents witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As\\nlong as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to\\nattack the network, they\\'ll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The\\nnetwork itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort\\nbasis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest\\nproof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.\\n1.\\nIntroduction\\nCommerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as\\ntrusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for\\nmost transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.\\nCompletely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot\\navoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the\\nminimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,\\nand there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-\\nreversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must\\nbe wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.\\nA certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties\\ncan be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments\\nover a communications channel without a trusted party.\\nWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,\\nallowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted\\nthird party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers\\nfrom fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In\\nthis paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed\\ntimestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The\\nsystem is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any\\ncooperating group of attacker nodes.\\n2.\\nTransactions\\nWe define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the coin to the\\nnext by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner\\nand adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of\\nownership.\\nThe problem of course is the payee can\\'t verify that one of the owners did not double-spend\\nthe coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every\\ntransaction for double spending. After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to\\nissue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent.\\nThe problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the\\ncompany running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.\\nWe need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier\\ntransactions. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don\\'t care\\nabout later attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to\\nbe aware of all transactions. In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and\\ndecided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be\\npublicly announced [1], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the\\norder in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the\\nmajority of nodes agreed it was the first received.\\n3.\\nTimestamp Server\\nThe solution we propose begins with a timestamp server. A timestamp server works by taking a\\nhash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a\\nnewspaper or Usenet post [2-5]. The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the\\ntime, obviously, in order to get into the hash. Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in\\nits hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.\\nBlock\\nItem\\nItem\\nHash\\nBlock\\nItem\\nItem\\nHash\\nTransaction\\nOwner 1\\'s\\nPublic Key\\nOwner 0\\'s\\nSignature\\nHash\\nTransaction\\nOwner 2\\'s\\nPublic Key\\nOwner 1\\'s\\nSignature\\nHash\\nVerify\\nTransaction\\nOwner 3\\'s\\nPublic Key\\nOwner 2\\'s\\nSignature\\nHash\\nVerify\\nOwner 2\\'s\\nPrivate Key\\nOwner 1\\'s\\nPrivate Key\\nSign\\nSign\\nOwner 3\\'s\\nPrivate Key\\n4.\\nProof-of-Work\\nTo implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof-\\nof-work system similar to Adam Back\\'s Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts.\\nThe proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the\\nhash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number\\nof zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.\\nFor our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the\\nblock until a value is found that gives the block\\'s hash the required zero bits. Once the CPU\\neffort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed\\nwithout redoing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block\\nwould include redoing all the blocks after it.\\nThe proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision\\nmaking. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone\\nable to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority\\ndecision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested\\nin it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the\\nfastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to\\nredo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the\\nwork of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up\\ndiminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.\\nTo compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time,\\nthe proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of\\nblocks per hour. If they\\'re generated too fast, the difficulty increases.\\n5.\\nNetwork\\nThe steps to run the network are as follows:\\n1)\\nNew transactions are broadcast to all nodes.\\n2)\\nEach node collects new transactions into a block.\\n3)\\nEach node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.\\n4)\\nWhen a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.\\n5)\\nNodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.\\n6)\\nNodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the\\nchain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.\\nNodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on\\nextending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some\\nnodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received,\\nbut save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proof-\\nof-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other\\nbranch will then switch to the longer one.\\nBlock\\nPrev Hash\\nNonce\\nTx\\nTx\\nBlock\\nPrev Hash\\nNonce\\nTx\\nTx\\nNew transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes. As long as they reach\\nmany nodes, they will get into a block before long. Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped\\nmessages. If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and\\nrealizes it missed one.\\n6.\\nIncentive\\nBy convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned\\nby the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides\\na way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.\\nThe steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending\\nresources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.\\nThe incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is\\nless than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of\\nthe block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered\\ncirculation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation\\nfree.\\nThe incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to\\nassemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it\\nto defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to\\nfind it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than\\neveryone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.\\n7.\\nReclaiming Disk Space\\nOnce the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before\\nit can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block\\'s hash,\\ntransactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block\\'s hash.\\nOld blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do\\nnot need to be stored.\\nA block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are\\ngenerated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems\\ntypically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore\\'s Law predicting current growth of\\n1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in\\nmemory.\\nBlock\\nBlock\\nBlock Header (Block Hash)\\nPrev Hash\\nNonce\\nHash01\\nHash0\\nHash1\\nHash2\\nHash3\\nHash23\\nRoot Hash\\nHash01\\nHash2\\nTx3\\nHash23\\nBlock Header (Block Hash)\\nRoot Hash\\nTransactions Hashed in a Merkle Tree\\nAfter Pruning Tx0-2 from the Block\\nPrev Hash\\nNonce\\nHash3\\nTx0\\nTx1\\nTx2\\nTx3\\n8.\\nSimplified Payment Verification\\nIt is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep\\na copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying\\nnetwork nodes until he\\'s convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch\\nlinking the transaction to the block it\\'s timestamped in. He can\\'t check the transaction for\\nhimself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it,\\nand blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.\\nAs such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more\\nvulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify\\ntransactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker\\'s fabricated\\ntransactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to\\nprotect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid\\nblock, prompting the user\\'s software to download the full block and alerted transactions to\\nconfirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to\\nrun their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.\\n9.\\nCombining and Splitting Value\\nAlthough it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a\\nseparate transaction for every cent in a transfer. To allow value to be split and combined,\\ntransactions contain multiple inputs and outputs. Normally there will be either a single input\\nfrom a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two\\noutputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender.\\nIt should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those\\ntransactions depend on many more, is not a problem here. There is never the need to extract a\\ncomplete standalone copy of a transaction\\'s history.\\nTransaction\\nIn\\nIn\\nOut\\nHash01\\nHash2\\nHash3\\nHash23\\nBlock Header\\nMerkle Root\\nPrev Hash\\nNonce\\nBlock Header\\nMerkle Root\\nPrev Hash\\nNonce\\nBlock Header\\nMerkle Root\\nPrev Hash\\nNonce\\nMerkle Branch for Tx3\\nLongest Proof-of-Work Chain\\nTx3\\n10. Privacy\\nThe traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the\\nparties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly\\nprecludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in\\nanother place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending\\nan amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is\\nsimilar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of\\nindividual trades, the \"tape\", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.\\nAs an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them\\nfrom being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input\\ntransactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk\\nis that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to\\nthe same owner.\\n11. Calculations\\nWe consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest\\nchain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such\\nas creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are\\nnot going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block\\ncontaining them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back\\nmoney he recently spent.\\nThe race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial\\nRandom Walk. The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its\\nlead by +1, and the failure event is the attacker\\'s chain being extended by one block, reducing the\\ngap by -1.\\nThe probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler\\'s\\nRuin problem. Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit starts at a deficit and plays potentially an\\ninfinite number of trials to try to reach breakeven. We can calculate the probability he ever\\nreaches breakeven, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows [8]:\\np = probability an honest node finds the next block\\nq = probability the attacker finds the next block\\nqz = probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind\\nq z={\\nif p≤q\\nq/ p\\nz\\nif pq}\\nIdentities\\nTransactions\\nTrusted\\nThird Party\\nCounterparty\\nPublic\\nIdentities\\nTransactions\\nPublic\\nNew Privacy Model\\nTraditional Privacy Model\\nGiven our assumption that p > q, the probability drops exponentially as the number of blocks the\\nattacker has to catch up with increases. With the odds against him, if he doesn\\'t make a lucky\\nlunge forward early on, his chances become vanishingly small as he falls further behind.\\nWe now consider how long the recipient of a new transaction needs to wait before being\\nsufficiently certain the sender can\\'t change the transaction. We assume the sender is an attacker\\nwho wants to make the recipient believe he paid him for a while, then switch it to pay back to\\nhimself after some time has passed. The receiver will be alerted when that happens, but the\\nsender hopes it will be too late.\\nThe receiver generates a new key pair and gives the public key to the sender shortly before\\nsigning. This prevents the sender from preparing a chain of blocks ahead of time by working on\\nit continuously until he is lucky enough to get far enough ahead, then executing the transaction at\\nthat moment. Once the transaction is sent, the dishonest sender starts working in secret on a\\nparallel chain containing an alternate version of his transaction.\\nThe recipient waits until the transaction has been added to a block and z blocks have been\\nlinked after it. He doesn\\'t know the exact amount of progress the attacker has made, but\\nassuming the honest blocks took the average expected time per block, the attacker\\'s potential\\nprogress will be a Poisson distribution with expected value:\\n=z q\\np\\nTo get the probability the attacker could still catch up now, we multiply the Poisson density for\\neach amount of progress he could have made by the probability he could catch up from that point:\\n∑\\nk=0\\n∞\\nke\\n−\\nk! ⋅{\\nq/ p\\nz−k\\nif k≤z\\nif kz}\\nRearranging to avoid summing the infinite tail of the distribution...\\n1−∑\\nk=0\\nz\\nk e\\n−\\nk!\\n1−q/ p\\nz−k\\nConverting to C code...\\n#include <math.h>\\ndouble AttackerSuccessProbability(double q, int z)\\n{\\ndouble p = 1.0 - q;\\ndouble lambda = z * (q / p);\\ndouble sum = 1.0;\\nint i, k;\\nfor (k = 0; k <= z; k++)\\n{\\ndouble poisson = exp(-lambda);\\nfor (i = 1; i <= k; i++)\\npoisson *= lambda / i;\\nsum -= poisson * (1 - pow(q / p, z - k));\\n}\\nreturn sum;\\n}\\nRunning some results, we can see the probability drop off exponentially with z.\\nq=0.1\\nz=0 P=1.0000000\\nz=1 P=0.2045873\\nz=2 P=0.0509779\\nz=3 P=0.0131722\\nz=4 P=0.0034552\\nz=5 P=0.0009137\\nz=6 P=0.0002428\\nz=7 P=0.0000647\\nz=8 P=0.0000173\\nz=9 P=0.0000046\\nz=10 P=0.0000012\\nq=0.3\\nz=0 P=1.0000000\\nz=5 P=0.1773523\\nz=10 P=0.0416605\\nz=15 P=0.0101008\\nz=20 P=0.0024804\\nz=25 P=0.0006132\\nz=30 P=0.0001522\\nz=35 P=0.0000379\\nz=40 P=0.0000095\\nz=45 P=0.0000024\\nz=50 P=0.0000006\\nSolving for P less than 0.1%...\\nP < 0.001\\nq=0.10 z=5\\nq=0.15 z=8\\nq=0.20 z=11\\nq=0.25 z=15\\nq=0.30 z=24\\nq=0.35 z=41\\nq=0.40 z=89\\nq=0.45 z=340\\n12. Conclusion\\nWe have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust. We started with\\nthe usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of\\nownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending. To solve this, we\\nproposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions\\nthat quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes\\ncontrol a majority of CPU power. The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes\\nwork all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are\\nnot routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can\\nleave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what\\nhappened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of\\nvalid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on\\nthem. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.\\nReferences\\n[1]\\nW. Dai, \"b-money,\" http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt, 1998.\\n[2]\\nH. Massias, X.S.

A DON is a network maintained by a committee of Chainlink\\nnodes.\\nIt supports any of an unlimited range of oracle functions chosen for\\ndeployment by the committee. A DON thus acts as a powerful abstraction layer,\\noffering interfaces for smart contracts to extensive off-chain resources and highly\\nefficient yet decentralized off-chain computing resources within the DON itself.\\nWith DONs as a springboard, Chainlink plans to focus on advances in seven\\nkey areas:\\n• Hybrid smart contracts: Offering a powerful, general framework for aug-\\nmenting existing smart contract capabilities by securely composing on-chain\\nand off-chain computing resources into what we call hybrid smart contracts.\\n• Abstracting away complexity: Presenting developers and users with simple\\nfunctionality eliminates the need for familiarity with complex underlying\\nprotocols and system boundaries.\\n• Scaling: Ensuring that oracle services achieve the latencies and throughputs\\ndemanded by high-performance decentralized systems.\\n• Confidentiality: Enabling next-generation systems that combine blockchains’\\ninnate transparency with strong new confidentiality protections for sensitive\\ndata.\\n• Order-fairness for transactions: Supporting transaction sequencing in ways\\nthat are fair for end users and prevent front-running and other attacks by\\nbots and exploitative miners.\\n• Trust-minimization: Creating a highly trustworthy layer of support for\\nsmart contracts and other oracle-dependent systems by means of decen-\\ntralization, strong anchoring in high-security blockchains, cryptographic\\ntechniques, and cryptoeconomic guarantees.\\n• Incentive-based (cryptoeconomic) security: Rigorously designing and ro-\\nbustly deploying mechanisms that ensure nodes in DONs have strong eco-\\nnomic incentives to behave reliably and correctly, even in the face of well-\\nresourced adversaries.\\nWe present preliminary and ongoing innovations by the Chainlink community\\nin each of these areas, providing a picture of the broadening and increasingly\\npowerful capabilities planned for the Chainlink network.\\nContents\\nIntroduction\\n1.1\\nDecentralized Oracle Networks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n1.2\\nSeven Key Design Goals . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

vs. Committee-Based Oracle Selection\\n5\\nIntroduction\\nBlockchain oracles are often viewed today as decentralized services with one objective:\\nto forward data from off-chain resources onto blockchains. It’s a short step, though,\\nfrom forwarding data to computing on it, storing it, or transmitting it bidirection-\\nally. This observation justifies a much broader notion of oracles’ functionality. So too\\ndo the growing service requirements of smart contracts and increasingly multifaceted\\ntechnologies that rely on oracle networks. In short, an oracle can and will need to\\nbe a general-purpose, bidirectional, compute-enabled interface between and among on-\\nchain and off-chain systems. Oracles’ role in the blockchain ecosystem is to enhance\\nthe performance, functionality, and interoperability of smart contracts so that they can\\nbring new trust models and transparency to a multiplicity of industries. This transfor-\\nmation will come about through broadening use of hybrid smart contracts, which fuse\\nblockchains’ special properties with the unique capabilities of off-chain systems such as\\noracle networks and thereby achieve far greater reach and power than on-chain systems\\nin isolation.\\nIn this whitepaper, we articulate a vision for what we call Chainlink 2.0, an evo-\\nlution of Chainlink beyond its initial conception in the original Chainlink whitepa-\\nper [98]. We foresee an increasingly expansive role for oracle networks, one in which\\nthey complement and enhance existing and new blockchains by providing fast, reli-\\nable, and confidentiality-preserving universal connectivity and computation for hybrid\\nsmart contracts. We believe that oracle networks will even evolve to become utilities\\nfor exporting high-integrity blockchain-grade data to systems beyond the blockchain\\necosystem.\\nToday, Chainlink nodes run by a diverse set of entities come together in oracle net-\\nworks to relay data to smart contracts in what are known as reports. We can view such\\noracle nodes as a committee similar to that in a classical-consensus blockchain [72],\\nbut with the goal of supporting existing blockchains, rather than providing freestand-\\ning functionality. With verifiable random functions (VRF) and Off-Chain Reporting\\n(OCR), Chainlink is already evolving toward a general-purpose framework and infras-\\ntructure for providing the computational resources that smart contracts require for\\nadvanced functionality.\\nThe foundation of our plan for Chainlink 2.0 is what we call Decentralized Oracle\\nNetworks, or DONs for short. Since we introduced the term “oracle network” in the\\noriginal Chainlink whitepaper [98], oracles have developed ever richer functionality and\\nbreadth of application. In this paper, we offer a fresh definition of the term according\\nto our future vision for the Chainlink ecosystem. In this view, a DON is a network\\nmaintained by a committee of Chainlink nodes. Rooted in a consensus protocol, it\\nsupports any of an unlimited range of oracle functions chosen for deployment by the\\ncommittee. A DON thus acts as a blockchain abstraction layer, providing interfaces\\nto off-chain resources for both smart contracts and other systems. It also provides\\naccess to highly efficient yet decentralized off-chain computing resources. In general,\\na DON supports operations on a main chain. Its goal is to enable secure and flexi-\\nble hybrid smart contracts, which combine on-chain and off-chain computation with\\nconnection to external resources.\\nWe emphasize that even with the use of committees in DONs, Chainlink itself\\nremains inherently permissionless. DONs act as the foundation of a permissionless\\nframework in which nodes can come together to implement custom oracle networks with\\ntheir own regimes for node inclusion, which may be permissioned or permissionless.\\nWith DONs as a foundation, we plan to focus in Chainlink 2.0 on advances in seven\\nkey areas: hybrid smart contracts, abstracting away complexity, scaling, confidential-\\nity, order-fairness for transactions, trust minimization, and incentive-based (cryptoeco-\\nnomic) security. In this paper introduction, we present an overview of Decentralized\\nOracle Networks in Section 1.1 and then our seven key areas of innovation in Sec-\\ntion 1.2. We describe the organization of the rest of this paper in Section 1.3.\\n1.1\\nDecentralized Oracle Networks\\nDecentralized Oracle Networks are designed to enhance and extend the capabilities\\nof smart contracts on a target blockchain or main chain through functions that are\\nnot available natively. They do so by providing the three basic resources found in\\ncomputing systems: networking, storage, and computation.\\nA DON aims to offer\\nthese resources with strong confidentiality, integrity, and availability properties,1 as\\nwell as accountability.\\nDONs are formed by committees of oracle nodes that cooperate to fulfill a specific\\njob or choose to establish a long-lived relationship in order to provide persistent services\\nto clients. DONs are designed in a blockchain-agnostic way. They promise to serve as\\na powerful and flexible tool for application developers to create off-chain support for\\ntheir smart contracts on any supported main chain.\\nTwo types of functionalities realize the capabilities of a DON: executables and\\nadapters. Executables are programs that run continuously and in a decentralized man-\\nner on the DON. While they do not directly store main-chain assets, they have im-\\nportant benefits, including high performance and the ability to perform confidential\\ncomputation. Executables run autonomously on a DON and perform deterministic\\noperations. They work in hand with adapters that link the DON to external resources\\nand may be called by executables. Adapters, as we envision them for DONs, are a\\ngeneralization of the external adapters in Chainlink today. While existing adapters\\ntypically only fetch data from data sources, adapters may operate bidirectionally; in\\nDONs, they may additionally leverage joint computation by DON nodes to achieve\\nadditional features, such as encrypting reports for privacy-preserving consumption by\\nan executable.\\nTo provide a sense of a DON’s basic operation, Fig. 1 shows conceptually how a\\nDON might be used to send reports to a blockchain and thus achieve traditional, exist-\\ning oracle functionality. DONs can provide many additional features, however, beyond\\n1The “CIA triad” of information security [123, p. 26, §2.3.5].\\nChainlink’s existing networks. For example, within the general structure of Fig. 1,\\nthe executable could record fetched asset-price data on the DON, using such data to\\ncompute, e.g., a trailing average for its reports.\\nFigure 1: Conceptual figure showing as an example how a Decentralized Oracle Net-\\nwork can realize basic oracle functionality, i.e., relay off-chain data to a contract. An\\nexecutable uses adapters to fetch off-chain data, which it computes on, sending output\\nover another adapter to a target blockchain. (Adapters are initiated by code in the\\nDON, represented by small blue boxes; arrows show the direction of data flow for this\\nparticular example.) The executable can additionally read and write to local DON\\nstorage to keep state and/or communicate with other executables. Flexible network-\\ning, computation, and storage in DONs, all represented here, enable a host of novel\\napplications.\\nA major benefit of DONs is their ability to bootstrap new blockchain services. DONs\\nare a vehicle by which existing oracle networks can quickly stand up service applications\\nthat would today require the creation of purpose-built networks. We give a number of\\nexamples of such applications in Section 4.\\nIn Section 3, we provide more details on DONs, describing their capabilities in\\nterms of the interface they present to developers and users.\\n1.2\\nSeven Key Design Goals\\nHere we briefly review the seven key focuses enumerated above for the evolution of\\nChainlink, namely:\\nHybrid smart contracts:\\nCentral to our vision for Chainlink is the idea of securely\\ncombining on-chain and off-chain components in smart contracts. We refer to contracts\\nrealizing this idea as hybrid smart contracts or hybrid contracts.2\\nBlockchains are and will continue to play two critical roles in decentralized-service\\necosystems: They are both the loci where cryptocurrency ownership is represented\\nand robust anchors for decentralized services. Smart contracts must therefore be repre-\\nsented or executed on chain, but their on-chain capabilities are severely limited. Purely\\non-chain contract code is slow, expensive, and insular, unable to benefit from real-world\\ndata and a variety of functionalities that are inherently unachievable on chain, includ-\\ning various forms of confidential computation, generation of (pseudo)randomness secure\\nagainst miner / validator manipulation, etc.\\nFor smart contracts to realize their full potential therefore requires smart contracts\\nto be architected with two parts: an on-chain part (which we typically denote by SC)\\nand an off-chain part, an executable running on a DON (which we typically denote by\\nexec). The goal is to achieve a secure composition of on-chain functionality with the\\nmultiplicity of off-chain services that DONs aim to provide. Together, the two parts\\nmake up a hybrid contract. We present the idea conceptually in Fig. 2. Already today,\\nChainlink services3 such as data feeds and VRFs are enabling otherwise unachievable\\nsmart contract applications, ranging from DeFi to fairly generated NFTs to decentral-\\nized insurance, as first steps toward a more general framework. As Chainlink services\\nexpand and grow more performant according to our vision in this whitepaper, so too\\nwill the power of smart contract systems across all blockchains.\\nOur other six key focuses in this whitepaper may be viewed as acting in the service\\nof the first, overarching one of hybrid contracts. These focuses involve removing visible\\ncomplexity from hybrid contracts, creating additional off-chain services that enable the\\nconstruction of ever more capable hybrid contracts, and, in the case of trust minimiza-\\ntion, bolstering the security properties achieved by hybrid contracts. We leave the idea\\nof hybrid contracts implicit throughout much of the paper, but any combination of\\nMAINCHAIN logic with a DON may be viewed as a hybrid contract.\\nAbstracting away complexity:\\nDONs are designed to make use of decentralized\\nsystems easy for developers and users by abstracting away the often complex machinery\\nbehind DONs’ powerful and flexible array of services.\\nExisting Chainlink services\\nalready have this feature.\\nFor example, data feeds in Chainlink today present on-\\nchain interfaces that do not require developers to concern themselves with protocol-\\nlevel details, such as the means by which OCR enforces consensus reporting among a\\n2The idea of on-chain / off-chain contract composition has arisen previously in various constrained\\nforms, e.g., layer-2 systems, TEE-based blockchains [80], etc. Our goal is to support and generalize\\nthese approaches and ensure that they can encompass off-chain data access and other key oracle\\nservices.\\n3Chainlink services comprise a variety of decentralized services and functionality available through\\nthe network. They are offered by the numerous node operators composed into various oracle networks\\nacross the ecosystem.\\nFigure 2: Conceptual figure depicting on-chain / off-chain contract composition. A\\nhybrid smart contract 3⃝consists of two complementary components: an on-chain\\ncomponent SC 1⃝, resident on a blockchain, and an off-chain component exec 2⃝that\\nexecutes on a DON. The DON serves as a bridge between the two components as well\\nas connecting the hybrid contract with off-chain resources such as web services, other\\nblockchains, decentralized storage, etc.\\ndecentralized set of nodes. DONs go a step further in the sense that they expand the\\nrange of services for which Chainlink can offer developers an abstraction layer with\\naccompanying streamlined interfaces for high-level services.\\nWe present several application examples in Section 4 that highlight this approach.\\nWe envision enterprises, for instance, using DONs as a form of secure middleware to\\nconnect their legacy systems to blockchains. (See Section 4.2.) This use of DONs ab-\\nstracts away the complexity of general blockchain dynamics (fees, reorgs, etc.). It also\\nabstracts away the features of specific blockchains, thereby enabling enterprises to con-\\nnect their existing systems to an ever-broadening array of blockchain systems without\\na need for specialized expertise in these systems or, more generally, in decentralized-\\nsystems development.\\nUltimately, our ambition is to push the degree of abstraction achieved by Chainlink\\nto the point of implementing what we refer to as a decentralized metalayer. Such a layer\\nwould abstract away the on-chain / off-chain distinction for all classes of developers\\nand users of DApps, allowing seamless creation and use of decentralized services.\\nTo simplify the development process, developers could specify DApp functional-\\nity in the metalayer as a virtual application in a unified machine model. They could\\nthen use a decentralized-metalayer compiler to instantiate the DApp automatically as\\na set of interoperating decentralized functionalities spanning blockchains, DONs, and\\nexternal services. (One of these external services could be an enterprise system, mak-\\ning the metalayer useful for applications involving legacy enterprise systems.) Such\\ncompilation is akin to how modern compilers and software-development kits (SDKs)\\nsupport generalist programmers in using the full potential of heterogeneous hardware\\narchitectures consisting of a general-purpose CPU and specialized hardware like GPUs,\\nmachine-learning accelerators, or trusted enclaves. Fig. 3 presents this idea at a con-\\nceptual level.\\nHybrid smart contracts are a first step along the way to this vision and to a con-\\ncept we call meta contracts. Meta contracts are applications coded on a decentralized\\nmetalayer and implicitly encompass on-chain logic (smart contracts), as well as off-\\nchain computation and connectivity among various blockchains and existing off-chain\\nservices. Given the need for language and compiler support, new security models, and\\nconceptual and technical harmonization of disparate technologies, however, realization\\nof a true decentralized metalayer is an ambitious goal to which we aspire over a long\\ntime horizon. It is nonetheless a helpful ideal model to keep in mind while reading\\nthis paper, not detailed here, but something we plan to focus on in our future work on\\nChainlink.\\nScaling:\\nA goal of preeminent importance in our evolving designs is enabling the\\nChainlink network to meet the growing scaling needs of the blockchain ecosystem.\\nWith network congestion becoming a recurring problem in existing permissionless\\nblockchains [86], new and more performant blockchain designs are coming into use,\\ne.g., [103, 120, 203], as well as complementary layer-2 scaling technologies, e.g., [5,\\n12, 121, 141, 169, 186, 187]. Oracle services must achieve latencies and throughputs\\nthat meet the performance demands of these systems while minimizing on-chain fees\\n(e.g., gas costs) for contract operators and ordinary users alike. With DONs, Chainlink\\nfunctionality aims to go further and deliver performance high enough for purely web-\\nbased systems.\\nDONs derive much of their performance gain from their use of fast, committee-\\nbased or permissionless consensus protocols, which they combine with the blockchains\\nthey support. We expect many DONs with different configurations to run in paral-\\nlel; different DApps and users can navigate tradeoffs in underlying consensus choices\\naccording to their application requirements.\\nDONs may be viewed in effect as layer-2 technologies.\\nWe expect that among\\nother services, DONs will support the Transaction Execution Framework (TEF), which\\nfacilitates efficient integration of DONs and thus oracles with other high-performance\\nlayer-2 systems-e.g., rollups, systems which bundle transactions offchain to achieve\\nperformance improvements. We introduce the TEF in Section 6.\\nFigure 3: Conceptual figure showing ideal realization of a decentralized metalayer. For\\nease of development, a developer specifies a DApp, highlighted in pink, as a virtual\\napplication in a unified machine model. A decentralized-metalayer compiler automati-\\ncally generates corresponding interoperating functionalities: smart contracts (denoted\\nby SC), logic (denoted by exec) on DONs, adapters connecting to target external ser-\\nvices, and so forth, as indicated in yellow highlight.\\nFig. 4 shows conceptually how DONs improve blockchain (smart contract) scaling\\nby concentrating transaction and oracle-report processing offchain, rather than on\\nchain. This shift in the main locus of computation reduces transaction latency and\\nfees while boosting transaction throughput.\\nConfidentiality:\\nBlockchains provide unprecedented transparency for smart con-\\ntracts and the applications they realize. But there is a basic tension between trans-\\nparency and confidentiality. Today, for example, users’ decentralized exchange trans-\\nFigure 4: Conceptual figure showing how Decentralized Oracle Networks improve the\\nscaling of blockchain-enabled smart contracts. Figure A\\n⃝shows a conventional oracle\\narchitecture. Transactions are sent directly to the blockchain, as are oracle reports.\\nThus the blockchain, highlighted in yellow, is the main locus for transaction process-\\ning. Figure B⃝shows use of a DON to support contracts on the blockchain. A DON\\nexecutable processes transactions along with data from external systems and forwards\\nresults-e.g., bundled transactions or contract state changes resulting from the trans-\\nactions’ effects-to the blockchain. The DON, highlighted in yellow, is thus the main\\nlocus for transaction processing.\\nactions are recorded on chain, making it easy to monitor exchange behavior, but also\\nmaking users’ financial transactions publicly visible. Similarly, data relayed to smart\\ncontracts remains on chain. This makes such data conveniently auditable, but acts as\\na disincentive for data providers wishing to furnish smart contracts with sensitive or\\nproprietary data.\\nWe believe that oracle networks will play a pivotal role in catalyzing next-generation\\nsystems that combine blockchains’ innate transparency with new confidentiality pro-\\ntections. In this paper, we show how they will do so using three main approaches:\\n• Confidentiality-preserving adapters: Two technologies with planned deployment\\nin Chainlink’s networks, DECO [234] and Town Crier [233], enable oracle nodes to\\nretrieve data from off-chain systems in ways that protect user privacy and data\\nconfidentiality. They will play a key role in the design of adapters for DONs.\\n(See Section 3.6.2 for details on these two technologies.)\\n• Confidential computation: DONs can simply conceal their computation from re-\\nlying blockchains. Using secure multi-party computation and/or trusted execu-\\ntion environments, stronger confidentiality is also possible in which DON nodes\\ncompute over data into which they themselves do not have visibility.\\n• Support for confidential layer-2 systems: The TEF is designed to support a va-\\nriety of layer-2 systems, many of which use zero-knowledge proofs to provide\\nvarious forms of transaction confidentiality.\\nWe discuss these approaches in Section 3 (with additional details in Section 6, Ap-\\npendix B.1, and Appendix B.2).\\nFig. 5 presents a conceptual view of how sensitive data might flow from exter-\\nnal sources to a smart contract by means of confidentiality-preserving adapters and\\nconfidential computation in a DON.\\nFigure 5: Conceptual diagram of confidentiality-preserving operations in a DON on\\nsensitive data (highlighted in yellow).\\nSensitive source data (black circles) in web\\nservers is extracted to the DON using confidentiality-preserving adapters (blue, double-\\narrowed lines). The DON receives derived data (hollow circles) from these adapters-\\nthe result of applying either a function or, e.g., secret-sharing, to the sensitive source\\ndata. An executable on the DON may apply confidential computation to derived data\\nto construct a report (double circle), which it sends over an adapter to the blockchain.\\nWe believe that powerful tools for handling confidential data will open up a whole\\nrange of applications.\\nAmong these are private decentralized (and centralized) fi-\\nnance, decentralized identity, credit-based on-chain lending, and more efficient and\\nuser-friendly know-your-customer and accreditation protocols, as we discuss in Sec-\\ntion 4.\\nOrder-fairness for transactions:\\nToday’s blockchain designs have a dirty little\\nopen secret: They are ephemerally centralized. Miners and validators can order trans-\\nactions however they choose. Transaction order can also be manipulated by users as\\na function of the network fees they pay (e.g., gas prices in Ethereum) and to some\\nextent by taking advantage of fast network connections. Such manipulation can, for\\nexample, take the form of front-running, in which a strategic actor such as a miner\\nobserves a user’s transaction and inserts its own exploitative transaction into an earlier\\nposition in the same block-effectively stealing money from the user by leveraging ad-\\nvance knowledge of the user’s transaction. For example, a bot may place a buy order\\nbefore a user’s. It can then take advantage of the asset price increase induced by the\\nuser’s trade.\\nFront-running by some bots that harms ordinary users-analogous to high-frequency\\ntrading on Wall Street-is already prevalent and well documented [90], as are related\\nattacks such as back-running [159] and automated transaction mimicking [195]. Pro-\\nposals to systematize order exploitation by miners have even surfaced recently [110].\\nLayer-2 technologies such as rollups don’t solve the problem, but merely re-centralize\\nordering, placing it in the hands of the entity that creates a rollup.\\nOne of our goals is to introduce into Chainlink a service called Fair Sequencing\\nServices (FSS) [137]. FSS helps smart contract designers ensure fair ordering for their\\ntransactions and avoid front-running, back-running, and related attacks on user trans-\\nactions as well as other types of transactions, such as oracle report transmission. FSS\\nenables a DON to implement ideas such as the rigorous, temporal notion of order-\\nfairness introduced in [144]. As an incidental benefit, FSS can also lower users’ network\\nfees (e.g., gas costs).\\nBriefly, in FSS, transactions pass through the DON, rather than propagating di-\\nrectly to a target smart contract. The DON orders the transactions and then forwards\\nthem to the contract.\\nFigure 6: Example of how FSS is beneficial. Fig. A\\n⃝shows how a miner, exploiting its\\ncentralized power to order transactions, may swap a pair of transactions: transaction 1⃝\\narrives before 2⃝, but the miner instead sequences it after 2⃝. In contrast, Fig. B⃝shows\\nhow a DON decentralizes the ordering process among DON nodes. If a quorum of\\nhonest nodes receive 1⃝before 2⃝, the FSS causes 1⃝to appear before 2⃝on chain-\\npreventing miner reordering by attaching contract-enforceable sequence numbers.\\nFig. 6 compares standard mining with FSS. It shows how in standard mining,\\nthe process of transaction ordering is centralized with the miner and thus subject to\\nmanipulation, such as reordering a pair of transactions with respect to their arrival\\ntimes. In contrast, in FSS, the process is decentralized among DON nodes. Assuming\\na quorum of honest nodes, FSS helps enforce policies such as temporal ordering of\\ntransactions, reducing opportunities for manipulation by miners and other entities.\\nAdditionally, since users need not compete for preferential ordering based on gas price,\\nthey can pay relatively low gas prices (while transactions from the DON can be batched\\nfor gas savings).\\nTrust minimization:\\nOur general aim in the design of DONs is to facilitate a highly\\ntrustworthy layer of support for smart contracts and other oracle-dependent systems\\nby means of decentralization, cryptographic tools, and cryptoeconomic guarantees.\\nA DON itself is decentralized, and users can choose from any available DON that\\nsupports the main chain on which they wish to operate or spawn additional DONs\\nwith committees of nodes they trust.\\nFor some applications, however, particularly smart contracts, Chainlink users may\\nfavor a trust model that treats the main chain supported by a DON as more trustworthy\\nthan the DON itself. For such users, we already have or plan to incorporate into the\\narchitecture of the Chainlink network a number of mechanisms that enable contracts\\non a main chain to strengthen the security assurances provided by DONs, while at the\\nsame time also enforcing protections against the possibility of corrupted data sources\\nsuch as the web servers from which the DON obtains data.\\nWe describe these mechanisms in Section 7. They fall under five main headings:\\n• Data-source authentication: Tools that enable data providers to digitally sign\\ntheir data and thereby strengthen the chain of custody between the origin and\\nrelying contract.\\n• DON minority reports: Flags issued by a minority subset of DON nodes that\\nobserves majority malfeasance in the DON.\\n• Guard rails: Logic on a main chain that detects anomalous conditions and pauses\\nor halts contract execution (or invokes other remediations).\\n• Trust-minimized governance: Use of gradual-release updates to facilitate com-\\nmunity inspection, as well as decentralized emergency interventions for rapid\\nresponse to system failures.\\n• Decentralized entity authentication: Use of public-key infrastructure (PKI) to\\nidentify entities in the Chainlink network.\\nFig. 7 presents a conceptual schematic of our trust-minimization goals.\\nIncentive-based (cryptoeconomic) security:\\nDecentralization of report genera-\\ntion across oracle nodes helps ensure security even when some nodes are corrupted.\\nFigure 7: Conceptual depiction of Chainlink’s trust-minimization goal, which is to\\nminimize users’ need for correct behavior of the DON and data sources such as web\\nservers. Yellow highlights in the figure indicate trust-minimization loci: the DON and\\nindividual or minority sets of web servers. Pink highlights indicate system components\\nthat are highly trustworthy by assumption: contracts on the blockchain and a majority\\nof web servers, i.e., web servers in the aggregate.\\nEqually important, though, is ensuring that nodes have a financial incentive to be-\\nhave correctly. Staking, i.e., requiring nodes to provide deposits of LINK and slashing\\n(confiscating) these deposits in case of misbehavior, will play a key role in Chain-\\nlink. It is an important incentive design already used in a number of blockchains,\\ne.g., [81, 103, 120, 204].\\nStaking in Chainlink, however, looks very different from staking in standalone\\nblockchains. Staking in blockchains aims to prevent attacks on consensus. It has a\\ndifferent goal in Chainlink: to ensure timely delivery of correct oracle reports. A well-\\ndesigned staking system for an oracle network should render attacks such as bribery\\nunprofitable for an adversary, even when the target is a smart contract with high\\nmonetary value.\\nIn this paper, we present a general approach to staking in Chainlink with three key\\ninnovations:\\n1. A powerful adversarial model that encompasses attacks overlooked in existing\\napproaches. One example is what we call prospective bribery. This is a form of\\nbribery that determines which nodes receive bribes on a conditional basis, e.g.,\\noffers guaranteed bribes in advance to nodes that a staking mechanism selects at\\nrandom for particular roles (such as triggering report adjudication).\\n2. Super-linear staking impact, meaning informally that to be successful, an ad-\\nversary must have a budget $B greater than the combined deposits of all oracle\\nnodes.\\nMore precisely, we mean that as a function of n, $B(n) ≫$dn in a\\nnetwork of n oracle nodes each with a fixed deposit amount $d (more formally,\\n$B(n) is asymptotically larger in n than $dn). Fig. 8 gives a conceptual view of\\nthis property.\\n3. The Implicit-Incentive Framework (IIF), an incentive model we have devised to\\nencompass empirically measurable incentives beyond explicit deposited staking\\nfunds, including nodes’ future fee opportunities. The IIF extends the notion of\\nstake beyond explicit node deposits.\\nFigure 8: Conceptual diagram depicting super-linear scaling in Chainlink staking. The\\nbribe $B(n) required by an adversary grows faster in n than the combined deposits\\n$dn of all oracle nodes.\\nWe show how the IIF and super-linear staking impact together induce what we\\ncall a virtuous cycle of economic security for oracle networks. When new users enter\\nthe system, increasing potential future earnings from running Chainlink nodes, the\\nmarginal cost of economic security drops for current and future users. In a regime of\\nelastic demand, this diminished cost incentivizes additional users to make use of the\\nnetwork, continuously perpetuating adoption in an ongoing virtuous cycle.\\nNote: While this whitepaper outlines important elements of our vision for the evolu-\\ntion of Chainlink, it is informal and includes few detailed technical specifics. We plan to\\nrelease focused technical papers on additional features and approaches as they evolve.\\nFurthermore, it is important to emphasize that many elements of the vision presented\\nhere (scaling improvements, confidentiality technologies, FSS, etc.) can and will be\\ndeployed in preliminary form even before advanced DONs become a basic feature of\\nChainlink.\\n1.3\\nOrganization of this Paper\\nWe present our security model and notation in Section 2 and outline the Decentralized\\nOracle Network API in Section 3. In Section 4, we present a number of examples of\\napplications for which DONs provide an appealing deployment platform. Readers can\\nlearn most of the key concepts of the paper by reading up to this point.\\nThe remainder of the paper contains further details. We describe Fair Sequencing\\nServices (FSS) in Section 5 and the Transaction-Execution Framework (TEF) in Sec-\\ntion 6. We describe our approach to trust minimization in Section 7. We consider some\\nimportant DON deployment requirements, namely incremental rollout of features, dy-\\nnamic ledger membership, and accountability in Section 8. Finally, in Section 9, we give\\nan overview of our developing approach to incentive design. We conclude in Section 10.\\nTo help readers who have limited familiarity with the concepts in this paper, we\\nprovide a glossary in Appendix A. We present further detail on the DON interface\\nand functionality in Appendix B and present some example adapters in Appendix C.\\nIn Appendix D, we describe a cryptographic primitive for trust-minimized data-source\\nauthentication called functional signatures and introduce a new variant called dis-\\ncretized functional signatures. We discuss some considerations bearing on committee\\nselection for DONs in Appendix F.\\nSecurity Model and Goals\\nA Decentralized Oracle Network is a distinct distributed system that we expect will\\ninitially be implemented typically-although not necessarily-by a committee-based\\nconsensus protocol and run by a set of oracle nodes. A DON is designed primarily\\nto augment the capabilities of a smart contract on a main chain with oracle reports\\nand other services, but it can provide those same supporting services to other non-\\nblockchain systems, and thus need not be associated with a particular main chain.\\nThe model and properties we consider are therefore largely independent of the use of\\nthe particular applications of a DON.\\n2.1\\nCurrent Architectural Model\\nIt is important to emphasize that Chainlink today is not a monolithic service, but rather\\na permissionless framework within which it is possible to launch distinct, independent\\nnetworks of oracle nodes [77]. Networks have heterogeneous sets of node operators and\\ndesigns. They may also differ in terms of the types of services they provide, which can\\ninclude, e.g., data feeds, Proof of Reserves, verifiable randomness, and so forth. Other\\ndifferences can include the degree of decentralization, size of the network in terms of\\nlocked value it supports, and various service-level parameters, such as data frequency\\nand accuracy.\\nChainlink’s permissionless model encourages the growth of an ecosystem in which\\nproviders specialize in the services they are best able to furnish to the community. This\\nmodel is likely to result in lower costs to users and higher service quality than a model\\nthat requires all nodes and networks to provide a full range of services, an approach\\nthat can easily devolve into system-wide adoption of the services representing the least\\ncommon denominator of resources available to nodes.\\nAs Chainlink evolves toward DON-based designs in Chainlink 2.0, we continue to\\nsupport the model of a permissionless, open framework, keeping in view the goal of\\nproviding users with a range of service choices that globally result in the best match\\nwith particular application requirements.\\n2.2\\nConsensus Assumptions\\nWe use the term Decentralized Oracle Network to encompass the full functionality of\\nthe oracle system we describe: both the data structure that oracle nodes maintain and\\nthe core API layered on top of it.\\nWe use the term ledger (lower case), denoted by L, to mean the underlying data\\nstructure maintained by a DON and used to support the particular services it provides.\\nWe emphasize that our DON framework does not treat L as a freestanding system like\\na blockchain: Its purpose is to support blockchains and other systems. Blockchains are,\\nof course, one way of realizing a trustworthy ledger, but there are others. We expect\\nDONs in many cases to realize their underlying ledgers using Byzantine Fault Tolerant\\n(BFT) systems, which considerably predate blockchains such as Bitcoin [174]. We use\\nBFT-type notation and properties throughout the paper for convenience, although we\\nemphasize that DONs can be realized using permissionless consensus protocols.\\nConceptually, a ledger L is a bulletin board on which data is linearly ordered.\\nWe view a ledger generally as having a few key properties commonly ascribed to\\nblockchains [115]. A ledger is:\\n• Append-only:\\nData, once added, cannot be removed or modified.\\n• Public:\\nAnyone can read its contents, which are consistent across time in the\\nview of all users.4\\n• Available: The ledger can always be written to by authorized writers and read\\nby anyone in a timely way.\\nAlternative properties are possible in the ledger for a DON when realized by a\\ncommittee. For instance, ledger write access might be restricted to certain users, as\\nmight read access for some applications, i.e., the ledger need not be public as defined\\nabove. Similarly, ledger rules might permit modification or redaction of data. We don’t\\nexplicitly consider such variants in this paper, however.\\nThe modular design of DONs can support any of a wide variety of modern BFT\\nprotocols, e.g., Hotstuff[231]. The exact choice will depend on trust assumptions and\\nnetwork characteristics among the oracle nodes. A DON could in principle alternatively\\nuse a highly performant permissionless blockchain for its ledger in its role supporting an\\nequally scalable layer-2 or blockchain system. Similarly, hybridization is also possible:\\nThe DON could in principle be composed of nodes that are validators in an existing\\nblockchain, e.g., in Proof-of-Stake systems in which committees are selected to execute\\ntransactions, e.g., [8, 81, 120, 146, 204]. This particular mode of operation requires that\\nnodes operate in a dual-use manner, i.e., operate both as blockchain nodes and DON\\nnodes. (See Section 8.2 for a discussion of techniques to ensure continuity in changing\\ncommittees and Appendix F for some caveats on random committee selection.)\\nIn practice, in modern BFT algorithms, nodes digitally sign messages on the ledger.\\nWe assume for convenience that L has an associated public key pkL and that its contents\\nare signed by the corresponding private key. This general notation applies even when\\ndata on L are signed using threshold signatures.5 Threshold signatures are convenient,\\nas they enable a persistent identity for a DON even with changes of membership in\\nthe nodes running it. (See Appendix B.1.3.) We thus assume that skL is secret-shared\\nin a (k, n)-threshold manner for some security parameter k, e.g., k = 2f + 1 and\\nn = 3f + 1, where f is the number of potentially faulty nodes. (By choosing k in this\\nway, we ensure that faulty nodes can neither learn skL nor mount a denial-of-service\\nattack preventing its use.)\\nA message on L takes the form M = (m, z), where m is a string and z a unique\\nsequential index number.\\nWhere applicable, we write messages in the form m =\\n⟨MessageType : payload⟩. The message type MessageType is syntactic sugar that in-\\ndicates the function of a particular message.\\n4In cases where a blockchain without finality realizes a ledger, inconsistency is typically abstracted\\naway by disregarding insufficiently deep blocks or “pruning” [115].\\n5In practice, some code bases, e.g., LibraBFT [205], a variant of Hotstuff, have currently adopted\\nmulti-signatures, rather than threshold signatures, trading offreduced communication complexity for\\nsimpler engineering. With some added cost, oracle nodes can append threshold signatures to messages\\nwritten to L even if the consensus protocol used for L doesn’t employ them.\\n2.3\\nNotation\\nWe denote the set of n oracle nodes running the ledger by O = {Oi}n\\ni=1.\\nSuch a\\nset of nodes is often called a committee. For simplicity, we assume that the set of\\noracles implementing DON functionality, i.e., services on top of L, is identical with\\nthat maintaining L, but they can be distinct. We let pki denote the public key of\\nplayer Oi, and ski the corresponding private key.\\nMost BFT algorithms require at least n = 3f + 1 nodes, where f is the number of\\npotentially faulty nodes; remaining nodes are honest, in the sense that they follow the\\nprotocol exactly as specified. We refer to the committee O as honest if it meets this\\nrequirement, i.e., has greater than a 2/3-fraction of honest nodes. Unless otherwise\\nstated, we assume that O is honest (and a static model of corruption). We use pkO /\\nskO interchangeably with pkL / skL, depending on the context.\\nWe let σ = Sigpk[m] denote a signature on message m with respect to pk, i.e., using\\ncorresponding private key sk. Let verify(pk, σ, m) →{false, true} denote a corre-\\nsponding signature verification algorithm. (We leave key generation implicit through-\\nout the paper.)\\nWe use the notation S to denote a data source and S to denote the full set of\\nnS sources in a given context. We denote by MAINCHAIN a smart-contract enabled\\nblockchain supported by a DON. We use the term relying contract to denote any smart\\ncontract on MAINCHAIN that communicates with a DON, and use the notation SC to\\ndenote such a contract.\\nWe generally assume that a DON supports a single main chain MAINCHAIN, al-\\nthough it can support multiple such chains, as we show in examples in Section 4. A\\nDON can and typically will support multiple relying contracts on MAINCHAIN. (As\\nnoted above, a DON can alternatively support non-blockchain services.)\\n2.4\\nNote on Trust Models\\nAs noted above, DONs may be built atop committee-based consensus protocols, and we\\nexpect they will commonly use such protocols. There are many strong arguments that\\none of the two alternatives, committee-based or permissionless blockchains, provides\\nstronger security than the other.\\nIt is important to recognize that the security of committee-based vs. permissionless\\ndecentralized systems is incommensurable. Compromising a PoW or a PoS blockchain\\nvia 51% attack requires that an adversary obtain majority resources ephemerally and\\npotentially anonymously, for example by renting hash power in a PoW system. Such\\nattacks in practice have already impacted several blockchains [200, 34]. In contrast,\\ncompromising a committee-based system means corrupting a threshold number (typi-\\ncally one-third) of its nodes, where the nodes may be publicly known, well resourced,\\nand trustworthy entities.\\nOn the other hand, committee-based systems (as well as “hybrid” permissionless\\nsystems that support committees) can support more functionality than strictly per-\\nmissionless systems. This includes the ability to maintain persistent secrets, such as\\nsigning and/or encryption keys-one possibility in our designs.\\nWe emphasize that DONs can in principle be built atop either a committee-based or\\npermissionless consensus protocol and DON deployers may ultimately choose to adopt\\neither approach.\\nBolstering trust models:\\nA key feature of Chainlink today is the ability of users to\\nselect nodes based on decentralized records of their performance histories, as discussed\\nin Section 3.6.4. The staking mechanism and Implicit-Incentive Framework we intro-\\nduce in Section 9 together constitute a broadly scoped and rigorous mechanism-design\\nframework that will empower users with a greatly expanded ability to gauge the secu-\\nrity of DONs. This same framework will also make it possible for DONs themselves\\nto enforce various security requirements on participating nodes and ensure operation\\nwithin strong trust models.\\nIt is also possible using tools described in this paper for DONs to enforce spe-\\ncial trust-model requirements, such as compliance with regulatory requirements. For\\nexample, using techniques discussed in Section 4.3, nodes can present evidence of\\nnode-operator characteristics, e.g., territory of operation, that can be used to help\\nenforce compliance with, e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Ar-\\nticle 3 (“Territorial Scope”) [105]. Such compliance can otherwise be challenging to\\nmeet in decentralized systems [45].\\nAdditionally, in Section 7 we discuss plans to strengthen the robustness of DONs\\nthrough trust-minimization mechanisms on the main chains they support.\\nDecentralized Oracle Network Interface and Ca-\\npabilities\\nHere we briefly sketch the capabilities of DONs in terms of the simple but powerful\\ninterface they are designed to realize.\\nApplications on a DON are composed of executables and adapters. An executable is\\na program whose core logic is a deterministic program, analogous to a smart contract.\\nAn executable also has a number of accompanying initiators, programs that call entry\\npoints in the executable’s logic when predetermined events occur-e.g., at certain times\\n(like a cron job), when a price crosses a threshold, etc.-much like Keepers (see Sec-\\ntion 3.6.3). Adapters provide interfaces to off-chain resources and may be called by\\neither the initiators or core logic in executables. As their behavior may depend on that\\nof external resources, initiators and adapters may behave non-deterministically.\\nWe describe the DON developer interface and the functioning of executables and\\nadapters in terms of the three resources typically used to characterize computing sys-\\ntems: networking, compute, and storage. We give a brief overview of each of these\\nresources below and provide more details in Appendix B.\\n3.1\\nNetworking\\nAdapters are interfaces through which executables running on a DON can send and\\nreceive data from off-DON systems. Adapters may be viewed as a generalization of\\nthe adapters used in Chainlink today [20]. Adapters may be bidirectional-i.e., they\\ncannot just pull, but push data from a DON to a web server. They may also leverage\\ndistributed protocols as well as cryptographic functionality such as secure multi-party\\ncomputation.\\nFigure 9: Adapters connecting a DON, denoted DON1, with a range of different re-\\nsources, including another DON, denoted DON2, a blockchain (main chain) and its\\nmempool, external storage, a web server, and IoT devices (via a web server).\\nExamples of external resources for which adapters might be created are shown\\nin Fig. 9. They include:\\n• Blockchains: An adapter can define how to send transactions to a blockchain and\\nhow to read blocks, individual transactions, or other state from it. An adapter\\ncan also be defined for a blockchain’s mempool. (See Section 3.5.)\\n• Web servers: Adapters can define APIs through which data may be retrieved\\nfrom web servers, including legacy systems that are not specially adapted for\\ninterfacing with DONs. Such adapters can also include APIs to send data to\\nsuch servers. The web servers to which a DON connects may serve as gateways\\nto additional resources, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices.\\n• External storage: An adapter can define methods to read and write to storage\\nservices outside the DON, such as a decentralized file system [40, 188] or cloud\\nstorage.\\n• Other DONs: Adapters can retrieve and transmit data between DONs.\\nWe expect that initial deployments of DONs will include a set of building block\\nadapters for such commonly used external resources and will further allow DON-specific\\nadapters to be published by DON nodes. As smart contract developers write adapters\\ntoday, we expect that they will build even more powerful adapters using this advanced\\nfunctionality.\\nWe expect that ultimately it will be possible for users to create new adapters in a\\npermissionless manner.\\nSome adapters must be constructed in a way that ensures the persistence and avail-\\nability of external resources controlled by a DON. For example, cloud storage may\\nrequire maintenance of a cloud services account. Additionally, a DON can perform\\ndecentralized management of private keys on behalf of users (as in, e.g., [160]) and/or\\nexecutables. Consequently, the DON is capable of controlling resources, such as cryp-\\ntocurrency, that may be used, e.g., for sending transactions on a target blockchain.\\nSee Appendix B.1 for further details on DON adapters, as Appendix C for a few\\nexample adapters.\\n3.2\\nComputation\\nAn executable is the basic unit of code on a DON. An executable is a pair exec =\\n(logic, init). Here, logic is a deterministic program with a number of designated entry\\npoints (logic1, logic2, . . . , logicℓ) and init is a set of corresponding initiators\\n(init1, init2, . . . , inite). To ensure the full auditability of the DON, an executable’s logic\\nuses the underlying ledger L for all inputs and outputs. Thus, for instance, any adapter\\ndata serving as input to an executable must be stored first on L.\\nInitiators:\\nInitiators in Chainlink today cause event-dependent job executions on\\nChainlink nodes [21]. Initiators in DONs function in much the same way. A DON ini-\\ntiator, however, is specifically associated with an executable. An initiator may depend\\non an external event or state, on the current time, or on a predicate on DON state.\\nWith their dependency on events, initiators may of course behave non-deterministically\\n(as of course may adapters). An initiator can execute within individual DON nodes\\nand so need not rely on an adapter. (See Example 1 below.)\\nInitiators are an important feature distinguishing executables from smart contracts.\\nBecause an executable can run in response to an initiator, it can effectively operate\\nautonomously, as of course by extension can a hybrid contract incorporating the exe-\\ncutable. One form of initiators today are Chainlink Keepers, which provide transaction\\nautomation services, triggering smart contract execution-such as liquidation of un-\\ndercollateralized loans and execution of limit-order trades-based on oracle reports.\\nConveniently, initiators in DONs may also be viewed as a way of specifying the\\nservice agreements that apply to an executable, as they define the circumstances under\\nwhich the DON must call it.\\nThe following example illustrates how initiators work within an executable:\\nExample 1 (Deviation-triggered price feed). A smart contract SC may require fresh\\nprice-feed data (see Section 3.6.3) whenever there is a substantial change, e.g., 1%, in\\nthe exchange rate between a pair of assets, e.g., ETH-USD. Volatility-sensitive price\\nfeeds are supported in Chainlink today, but it is instructive to see how they can be\\nrealized on a DON by means of an executable execfeed.\\nThe executable execfeed maintains the most recent ETH-USD price r on L, in the\\nform of a sequence of ⟨NewPrice : j, r⟩entries, where j is an index incremented with\\neach price update.\\nAn initiator init1 causes each node Oi to monitor the current ETH-USD price for\\ndeviations of at least 1% from the most recently stored price r with index j. Upon\\ndetection of such a deviation, Oi writes its current view ri of the new price to L using\\nan entry of the form ⟨PriceView : i, j + 1, ri⟩.\\nA second initiator init2 fires when at least k such PriceView-entries with new price\\nvalues for index j + 1 created by distinct nodes have accumulated on L. Then, init2\\ninvokes an entry point logic2 to compute the median ρ of the first k fresh, valid price-\\nview values and writes a fresh value ⟨NewPrice : j + 1, ρ⟩to L . (Operationally, nodes\\nmay take turns as designated writers.)\\nA third initiator init3 watches for NewPrice entries on L. Whenever a new report\\n⟨NewPrice : j, r⟩appears there, it invokes an entry point logic3 that pushes (j, r) to SC\\nusing an adapter.\\nAs we have noted, an executable is similar in its capabilities to a smart contract.\\nApart from its higher performance, though, it differs from a typical main chain contract\\nin two essential ways:\\n1. Confidentiality: An executable can perform confidential computation, i.e., a se-\\ncret program may process cleartext inputs, or a published program may process\\nsecret input data, or a combination of both. In a simple model, secret data can\\nbe accessed by DON nodes, which conceal intermediate results and disclose only\\nprocessed and sanitized values to MAINCHAIN. It is also possible to conceal sen-\\nsitive data from DONs themselves: DONs are meant to support approaches such\\nas multi-party computation, e.g., [42, 157], and trusted execution environments\\n(TEEs) [84, 133, 152, 229] for this purpose.6\\n6By extension, keeping executables themselves secret with respect to DON nodes is also possible,\\nalthough this is only practical today for non-trivial executables using TEEs.\\n2. Supporting role: An executable is meant to support smart contracts on a main\\nchain, rather than replace them. An executable has several limitations that a\\nsmart contract does not:\\n(a) Trust model: An executable operates within the trust model defined by the\\nDON: Its correct execution relies on the honest behavior of O. (A main\\nchain can, however, provide some guard rails against DON malfeasance, as\\ndiscussed in Section 7.3.)\\n(b) Asset access: A DON can control an account on a blockchain-and thus\\ncontrol assets on it through an adapter. But a DON cannot authoritatively\\nrepresent assets created on a main chain, e.g., Ether or ERC20 tokens, since\\ntheir native chain maintains the authoritative record of their ownership.\\n(c) Lifecycle: DONs may be stood up intentionally with limited lifetimes, as\\ndefined by on-chain service level agreements between DONs and the owners\\nof relying contracts.\\nBlockchains, in contrast, are meant to function as\\npermanent archival systems.\\nSee Appendix B.2 for further details on DON computation.\\n3.3\\nStorage\\nAs a committee-based system, a DON can store moderate amounts of data persistently\\non L at much lower cost than a permissionless blockchain. Additionally, via adapters,\\nDONs can reference external decentralized systems for data storage, e.g., Filecoin [85],\\nand can thereby connect such systems to smart contracts. This option is particularly\\nattractive for bulk data as a means of addressing the pervasive problem of “bloat” in\\nblockchain systems.\\nDONs can thus store data locally or externally for use in their specifically sup-\\nported services. A DON can additionally make use of such data in a confidential way,\\ncomputing on data that is: (1) secret-shared across DON nodes or encrypted under\\na key managed by DON nodes in ways suitable for secure multi-party computation\\nor partial or fully homomorphic encryption; or (2) protected using a trusted execution\\nenvironment.\\nWe expect that DONs will adopt a simple memory-management model common to\\nsmart-contract systems: An executable may only write to its own memory. Executables\\nmay, however, read from the memory of other executables.\\nSee Appendix B.3 for further details on DON storage.\\n3.4\\nTransaction-Execution Framework (TEF)\\nDONs are intended to support contracts on a main chain MAINCHAIN (or on multi-\\nple main chains). The Transaction-Execution Framework (TEF), discussed in detail\\nin Section 6, is a general-purpose approach to the efficient execution of a contract\\nSC across MAINCHAIN and a DON. The TEF is intended to support FSS and layer-2\\ntechnologies-simultaneously, if desired. Indeed, it is likely to serve as the main vehicle\\nfor use of FSS (and for that reason, we do not further discuss FSS in this section).\\nBriefly, in TEF an original target contract SC designed or developed for MAINCHAIN\\nis refactored into a hybrid contract. This refactoring produces the two interoperating\\npieces of the hybrid contract: a MAINCHAIN contract SCa that we refer to for clarity\\nin the context of TEFs as an anchor contract and an executable execs on a DON. The\\ncontract SCa custodies users’ assets, executes authoritative state transitions, and also\\nprovides guard rails (see Section 7.3) against failures in the DON. The executable execs\\nsequences transactions and provides associated oracle data for them. It can bundle\\ntransactions for SCa in any of a number of ways-e.g., using validity-proof-based or\\noptimistic rollups, confidential execution by the DON, etc.\\nWe expect to develop tools that make it easy for developers to partition a contract\\nSC written in a high-level language into pieces of MAINCHAIN and DON logic, SCa and\\nexecs respectively, that compose securely and efficiently.\\nUsing TEF to integrate high-performance transaction schemes with high-performance\\noracles is integral to our oracle scaling approach.\\n3.5\\nMempool Services\\nAn important application-layer feature that we intend to deploy on DONs in support\\nof FSS and the TEF are Mempool Services (MS). MS may be viewed as an adapter,\\nbut one with first-class support.\\nMS provides support for legacy-compatible transaction processing. In this use, MS\\ningests from a main chain’s mempool those transactions intended for a target contract\\nSC on MAINCHAIN. MS then passes these transactions to an executable on the DON,\\nwhere they are processed in the desired way.\\nMS data can be used by the DON\\nto compose transactions that can then be passed directly to SC from the DON or\\nto another contract that calls SC. For example, the DON can forward transactions\\nharvested via MS, or it can use MS data to set gas prices for transactions it sends to\\nMAINCHAIN.\\nBecause it monitors the mempool, MS can obtain transactions from users inter-\\nacting directly with SC. Thus users may continue to generate their transactions using\\nlegacy software, i.e., applications unaware of the existence of MS and MS-configured\\ncontracts. (In this case, SC must be changed to ignore the original transactions and\\naccept only those processed by the MS, so as to avoid double-processing.)\\nFor use with a target contract SC, MS can be used with FSS and/or the TEF.\\n3.6\\nStepping Stones: Existing Chainlink Capabilities\\n3.6.1\\nOff-Chain Reporting (OCR)\\nOff-Chain Reporting (OCR) [60] is a mechanism in Chainlink for oracle report aggrega-\\ntion and transmission to a relying contract SC. Recently deployed for Chainlink price\\nfeed networks, it represents a first step along the path to full DONs.\\nAt its core, OCR is a BFT protocol designed to operate in a partially synchronous\\nnetwork. It ensures liveness and correctness in the presence of f < n/3 arbitrarily\\nfaulty nodes, guaranteeing the properties of Byzantine reliable broadcast, but it is not\\na complete BFT consensus protocol. Nodes do not maintain message logs that are\\nconsistent in the sense of representing a ledger that is identical in all of their views,\\nand the leader of the protocol may equivocate without violating safety.\\nOCR is currently designed for a particular message type: medianized aggregation of\\n(at least 2f +1) values reported by participating nodes. It provides a key assurance on\\nthe reports it outputs for SC, called attested reports: The median value in an attested\\nreport is equal to or lies between values reported by two honest nodes. This property is\\nthe key safety condition for OCR. The leader may have some influence on the median\\nvalue in an attested report, but only subject to this correctness condition. OCR can\\nbe extended to message types that aggregate values in different ways.\\nWhile the Chainlink network’s liveness and correctness goals today do not require\\nOCR to be a full-blown consensus protocol, they do require OCR to provide some addi-\\ntional forms of functionality not present in conventional BFT protocols, most notably:\\n1. All-or-nothing off-chain report broadcast: OCR ensures that an attested report\\nis made quickly available to all honest nodes or none of them. This is a fairness\\nproperty that helps ensure that honest nodes have an opportunity to participate\\nin attested report transmission.\\n2. Reliable transmission: OCR ensures, even in the presence of faulty or malicious\\nnodes, that all OCR reports and messages are transmitted to SC within a certain,\\npre-defined interval of time. This is a liveness property.\\n3. Contract-based trust minimization: SC filters out potentially erroneous OCR-\\ngenerated reports, e.g., if their reported values deviate significantly from other\\nrecently received ones. This is a form of extra-protocol correctness enforcement.\\nAll three of these properties will play a natural role in DONs. All-or-nothing off-\\nchain (DON) broadcast is an important building block for cryptoeconomic assurances\\naround reliable transmission, which is in turn an essential adapter property. Trust\\nminimization in SC is a type of guard rail, as discussed in Section 7.3.\\nOCR also provides a basis for operational deployment and refinement of BFT pro-\\ntocols in Chainlink’s oracle networks and thus, as noted above, a path to the full\\nfunctionality of DONs.\\n3.6.2\\nDECO and Town Crier\\nDECO [234] and Town Crier [233] are a pair of related technologies currently being\\ndeveloped in Chainlink networks.\\nMost web servers today allow users to connect over a secure channel using a protocol\\ncalled Transport Layer Security (TLS) [94]. (HTTPS indicates a variant of HTTP that\\nis enabled with TLS, i.e., URLs prefixed with “https” denote use of TLS for security.)\\nMost TLS-enabled servers have a notable limitation, though: They don’t digitally sign\\ndata. Consequently, a user or Prover cannot present the data she receives from a server\\nto a third party or Verifier, such as an oracle or smart contract, in a way that ensures\\nthe data’s authenticity.\\nEven if a server were to digitally sign data, there remains a problem of confiden-\\ntiality. A Prover may wish to redact or modify sensitive data before presenting it to a\\nVerifier. Digital signatures are designed specifically to invalidate modified data, how-\\never. They thus prevent a Prover from making confidentiality-preserving alterations\\nto data. (See Section 7.1 for more discussion.)\\nDECO and Town Crier are designed to allow a Prover to obtain data from a web\\nserver and present it to a Verifier in a way that ensures integrity and confidentiality.\\nThe two systems preserve integrity in the sense that they ensure that data presented by\\nthe Prover to the Verifier originates authentically from the target server. They support\\nconfidentiality in the sense of allowing the Prover to redact or modify data (while still\\npreserving integrity).\\nA key feature of both systems is that they do not require any modifications to a\\ntarget web server. They can operate with any existing TLS-enabled server. In fact,\\nthey are transparent to the server: From the viewpoint of the server, the Prover is\\nestablishing an ordinary connection.\\nThe two systems have similar goals, but differ in their trust models and implemen-\\ntations as we now briefly explain.\\nDECO makes fundamental use of cryptographic protocols to achieve its integrity\\nand confidentiality properties. While establishing a session with a target server us-\\ning DECO, the Prover engages at the same time in an interactive protocol with the\\nVerifier. This protocol enables the Prover to prove to the Verifier that it has received\\na given piece of data D from the server during its current session. The Prover can\\nalternatively present the Verifier with a zero-knowledge proof of some property of D\\nand thus not reveal D directly.\\nIn a typical use of DECO, a user or a single node can export data D from a private\\nsession with a web server to all of the nodes in a DON. As a result, the full DON can\\nattest to the authenticity of D (or a fact derived from D via a zero-knowledge proof).\\nIn addition to the example applications given later in the paper, this capability can be\\nused to amplify high-integrity access to a data source by a DON. Even if only one node\\nhas direct access to a data source-due, for instance, to an exclusive arrangement with\\na data provider-it remains possible for the entire DON to attest to the correctness of\\nreports emitted by that node.\\nTown Crier relies on the use of a trusted execution environment (TEE) such as Intel\\nSGX. Briefly, a TEE functions as a kind of black box that executes applications in a\\ntamperproof and confidential way. In principle, even the owner of the host on which\\nthe TEE is running can neither (undetectably) alter a TEE-protected application nor\\nview the application’s state, which may include secret data.\\nTown Crier can achieve all of the functionality of DECO and more. DECO con-\\nstrains the Prover to interaction with a single Verifier. In contrast, Town Crier enables\\na Prover to generate a publicly verifiable proof on data D fetched from a target server,\\ni.e., a proof that anyone, even a smart contract, can verify directly. Town Crier can\\nalso securely ingest and make use of secrets (e.g., user credentials).\\nThe main limitation of Town Crier is its reliance on TEEs. Production TEEs have\\nrecently been shown to have a number of serious vulnerabilities, although the technol-\\nogy is in its infancy and will undoubtedly mature. See Appendices B.2.1 and B.2.2 for\\nfurther discussion of TEEs.\\nFor a few example applications of DECO and Town Crier, see Sections 4.3, 4.5\\nand 9.4.3 and Appendix C.1.\\n3.6.3\\nExisting On-Chain Chainlink Services\\nChainlink oracle networks provide a number of main services across a multiplicity of\\nblockchains and other decentralized systems today.\\nFurther evolution as described\\nin this whitepaper will endow these existing services with additional capabilities and\\nreach. Three examples are:\\nData feeds:\\nToday, the majority of Chainlink users relying on smart contracts make\\nuse of data feeds. These are reports on the current value of key pieces of data according\\nto authoritative off-chain sources. For example, price feeds are feeds reporting the prices\\nof assets-cryptocurrencies, commodities, forex, indexes, equities, etc.-according to\\nexchanges or data-aggregation services. Such feeds today already help secure billions\\nof dollars in on-chain value through their use in DeFi systems such as Aave [147] and\\nSynthetix [208].\\nOther examples of Chainlink data feeds include weather data for\\nparametric crop insurance [75] and election data [93], among a number of others.\\nThe deployment of DONs and other technologies described in this paper will en-\\nhance provision of data feeds in Chainlink networks in many ways, including:\\n• Scaling: OCR and subsequently DONs aim to enable Chainlink services to scale\\ndramatically across the many blockchains they support. For example, we expect\\nthat DONs will help increase the number of data feeds provided by nodes using\\nChainlink from 100s to 1000s and beyond. Such scaling will help the Chainlink\\necosystem achieve its goal of furnishing data relevant to smart contracts compre-\\nhensively and both meeting and anticipating existing and future needs.\\n• Enhanced security: By storing intermediate reports, DONs will retain records\\nof node behaviors for high-fidelity monitoring and measurement of their perfor-\\nmance and accuracy, enabling strong empirical grounding of reputation systems\\nfor Chainlink nodes. FSS and the TEF will enable price feeds to be incorporated\\nwith transaction data in flexible ways that prevent attacks such as front-running.\\n(Explicit) staking will bolster existing cryptoeconomic protection of the security\\nof data feeds.\\n• Feed agility: As blockchain-agnostic systems (indeed, more broadly, consumer-\\nagnostic systems), DONs can facilitate the provision of data feeds to a multiplicity\\nof relying systems. A single DON can push a given feed simultaneously to a set\\nof different blockchains, eliminating the need for per-chain oracle networks and\\nenabling rapid deployment of existing feeds on new blockchains and of additional\\nfeeds across currently serviced blockchains.\\n• Confidentiality: The ability to perform generalized computation in a DON en-\\nables computations on sensitive data to take place offchain, avoiding on-chain\\nexposure.\\nAdditionally, using DECO or Town Crier, it is possible to achieve\\neven stronger confidentiality, allowing report generation based on data that isn’t\\nexposed even to DON nodes. See Section 4.3 and Section 4.5 for examples.\\nVerifiable Random Functions (VRFs):\\nSeveral types of DApps require a verifi-\\nably correct source of randomness to enable verification of their own fair operation.\\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are an example. The rarity of NFT features in Aaveg-\\notchi [23] and Axie Infinity [35] is determined by Chainlink VRF, as is the distribution\\nof NFTs by means of ticket-based drawings in Ether Cards [102]; the wide variety of\\ngaming DApps whose outcomes are randomized; and unconventional financial instru-\\nments, e.g., no-loss savings games such as PoolTogether [89], which allocate funds to\\nrandom winners. Other blockchain and non-blockchain applications also require secure\\nsources of randomness, including selection of decentralized-system committees and the\\nexecution of lotteries.\\nWhile block hashes can serve as a source of unpredictable randomness, they are vul-\\nnerable to manipulation by adversarial miners (and to some extent by users submitting\\ntransactions). Chainlink VRF [78] offers a considerably more secure alternative. An\\noracle has an associated private / public key pair (sk, pk) whose private key is main-\\ntained offchain and whose public key pk is published. To output a random value, it\\napplies sk to an unpredictable seed x furnished by a relying contract (e.g., a block hash\\nand DApp-specific parameters) using a function F, yielding y = Fsk(x) along with a\\nproof of correctness. (See [180] for the VRF available on Chainlink.) What makes a\\nVRF verifiable is the fact that with knowledge of pk, it is possible to check the correct-\\nness of the proof and therefore of y. The value y is consequently unpredictable to an\\nadversary that cannot predict x or learn sk and infeasible for the service to manipulate.\\nChainlink VRF may be viewed as just one of a family of applications that in-\\nvolve custodianship of private keys offchain. More generally, DONs can offer secure,\\ndecentralized storage of individual keys for applications and/or users, and combine\\nthis capability with generalized computation. The result is a host of applications, of\\nwhich we give some examples in this paper, including key management for Proof of\\nReserves (see Section 4.1) and for users’ decentralized credentials (and other digital\\nassets) (see Section 4.3).\\nKeepers:\\nChainlink Keepers [87] enable developers to write code for decentralized\\nexecution of off-chain jobs, generally to trigger execution of relying smart contracts.\\nBefore the advent of Keepers, it was common for developers to operate such off-chain\\nlogic themselves, creating centralized points of failure (as well as considerable du-\\nplicated development effort). Keepers instead provide an easy-to-use framework for\\ndecentralized outsourcing of these operations, enabling shorter development cycles and\\nstrong assurance of liveness and other security properties. Keepers can support any\\nof a wide variety of triggering goals, including price-dependent liquidation of loans or\\nexecution of financial transactions, time-dependent initiation of airdrops or payments\\nin systems with yield harvesting, and so forth.\\nIn the DON framework, initiators may be viewed as a generalization of Keep-\\ners in several senses. Initiators may make use of adapters, and thus can leverage a\\nmodularized library of interfaces to on-chain and off-chain systems, permitting rapid\\ndevelopment of secure, sophisticated functionality. Initiators initiate computation in\\nexecutables, which themselves offer the full versatility of DONs, permitting the wide\\nrange of decentralized services we present in this paper for on-chain and off-chain ap-\\nplications.\\n3.6.4\\nNode Reputation / Performance History\\nThe existing Chainlink ecosystem natively documents the performance histories of\\ncontributing nodes on chain. This feature has given rise to a collection of reputation-\\noriented resources that ingest, filter, and visualize performance data on individual\\nnode operators and data feeds. Users can reference these resources to make informed\\ndecisions in their selection of nodes and to monitor the operation of existing networks.\\nSimilar capabilities will help users choose DONs.\\nFor example, permissionless marketplaces today such as market.link allow node\\noperators to list their oracle services and attest to their off-chain identities through\\nservices such as Keybase [4], which bind the profile of a node in Chainlink to its\\nowner’s existing domain names and social media accounts. Additionally, performance\\nanalytics tools, such as those available at market.link and reputation.link, allow\\nusers to view statistics on the historical performance of individual nodes, including their\\naverage response latency, the deviation of values in their reports from consensus values\\nrelayed on chain, revenue generated, jobs fulfilled, and more. These analytics tools also\\nallow users to track the adoption of various oracle networks by other users, a form of\\nimplicit endorsement of the nodes securing such networks. The result is a flat “web of\\ntrust” in which, by using particular nodes, high-value decentralized applications create\\na signal of their trust in those nodes that other users can observe and factor into their\\nown node-selection decisions.\\nWith DONs (and initially with OCR) comes a shift in transaction processing and\\ncontract activity more generally offchain. A decentralized model for recording node\\nperformance remains possible within the DON itself. Indeed, the high performance\\nand data capacity of DONs make it possible to construct records in a fine-grained\\nway and also to perform decentralized computation on these records, yielding trust-\\nworthy summaries that can be consumed by reputation services and checkpointed on\\nMAINCHAIN.\\nWhile it is possible for a DON in principle to misrepresent the behavior of con-\\nstituent nodes if a large fraction of nodes is corrupted, we note that the collective\\nperformance of a DON itself in delivering on-chain data is visible on MAINCHAIN\\nand thus cannot be misrepresented. Additionally, we plan to explore mechanisms that\\nincentivize accurate internal reporting of node behaviors in a DON. For example, by re-\\nporting the subset of high-performing nodes that most quickly return data contributing\\nto a report relayed on chain, a DON creates an incentive for nodes to contest incorrect\\nreports: Incorrectly including nodes in this subset means incorrectly excluding nodes\\nthat should have been included and therefore invalidly penalizing them. Repeated re-\\nporting failures by a DON would also create an incentive for honest nodes to leave the\\nDON.\\nDecentralized compilation of accurate performance histories and the consequent\\nability of users to identify high-performing nodes and for node operators to build\\nreputations are important distinguishing features of the Chainlink ecosystem.\\nWe\\nshow in Section 9 how we can reason about them as a key piece of a rigorous and\\nexpansive view of the economic security provided by DONs.\\nDecentralized Services Enabled by Decentralized\\nOracle Networks\\nTo illustrate the versatility of DONs and how they enable a host of new services,\\nwe present five examples of DON-based applications in this section and describe the\\nhybrid contracts that realize them: (1) Proof of Reserves, a form of cross-chain service;\\n(2) Interfacing with enterprise / legacy systems, that is, creating a middleware-based\\nabstraction layer that facilitates development of blockchain applications with minimal\\nblockchain-specific code or expertise; (3) Decentralized identity, tools enabling users to\\nobtain and manage their own identity documents and credentials; (4) Priority channels,\\na service that ensures timely inclusion of critical-infrastructure transactions (e.g., oracle\\nreports) on a blockchain; and (5) Confidentiality-preserving DeFi, that is, financial\\nsmart contracts that conceal the sensitive data of participating parties.\\nHere, we\\nuse SC to denote the MAINCHAIN part of a hybrid contract and describe the DON\\ncomponent separately or in terms of an executable exec.\\n4.1\\nProof of Reserves\\nFor many applications, it is useful to relay state between or among blockchains. A\\npopular application of such services is cryptocurrency wrapping. Wrapped coins such\\nas WBTC [15] are becoming a popular asset in Decentralized Finance (DeFi). They\\ninvolve depositing the “wrapped” backing asset on its source blockchain MAINCHAIN(1)\\nand creating a corresponding token on a different, target blockchain MAINCHAIN(2).\\nFor example, WBTC is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain that corresponds\\nto BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain.\\nBecause contracts on MAINCHAIN(2) do not have direct visibility into MAINCHAIN(1),\\nthey must rely explicitly or implicitly on an oracle to report on deposits of the wrapped\\nasset in a smart contract, producing what is sometimes called a Proof of Reserves. In\\nWBTC [15], for example, custodian BitGo holds BTC and issues WBTC, with the\\nChainlink network providing Proofs of Reserve [76].\\nA DON can itself provide a Proof of Reserves. With a DON, however, it is possible\\nto go further. A DON can manage secrets and, through use of appropriate adapters,\\ncan transact on any desired blockchain. Consequently, it is possible for the DON to act\\nas one among a number of custodians-or even as a sole, decentralized custodian-for\\na wrapped asset. DONs can thereby serve as a platform to enhance the security of\\nexisting services that use Proofs of Reserves.\\nFor example, suppose that MAINCHAIN(1) is Bitcoin and MAINCHAIN(2) is Ethereum.\\nOn MAINCHAIN(2), a contract SC issues tokens representing wrapped BTC. The DON\\ncontrols a BTC address addr(1)\\nDON. To wrap BTC, then, a user U sends X BTC from\\naddr(1)\\nU\\nto addr(1)\\nDON along with a MAINCHAIN(2)-address addr(2)\\nU . The DON monitors\\naddr(1)\\nDON via an adapter to MAINCHAIN(1).\\nOn observing U’s deposit, with suffi-\\nciently high-probability confirmation, it sends a message to SC via an adapter to\\nMAINCHAIN(2). This message instructs SC to mint X tokens for addr(2)\\nU .\\nFor U to release X tokens, the reverse happens.\\nOn MAINCHAIN(1), however,\\naddr(1)\\nDON sends X BTC to addr(1)\\nU (or to another address, if thus requested by the user).\\nThese protocols can be adapted, of course, to work with exchanges, rather than directly\\nwith users.\\n4.2\\nInterfacing with Enterprise / Legacy Systems\\nDONs can serve as bridges between and among blockchains, as in the example of Proof\\nof Reserves, but another objective is for them to act as bidirectional bridges between\\nblockchains and legacy systems [176] or blockchain-like systems such as central bank\\ndigital currencies [30].\\nEnterprises face a number of challenges in connecting their existing systems and\\nprocesses to decentralized systems, including:\\n• Blockchain agility: Blockchain systems change rapidly. An enterprise may con-\\nfront the rapid new appearance or rise in popularity of blockchains on which\\ncounterparties wish to conduct transactions, but for which the enterprise has no\\nsupport in its existing infrastructure. In general, blockchains’ dynamism makes\\nit difficult for individual enterprises to remain abreast of the full ecosystem.\\n• Blockchain-specific development resources: For many organizations, hiring or in-\\ncubating cutting-edge blockchain expertise is difficult, particularly in view of the\\nchallenge of agility.\\n• Private-key management: Managing private keys for blockchains or cryptocurren-\\ncies requires operational expertise distinct from that of traditional cybersecurity\\npractices and unavailable to many enterprises.\\n• Confidentiality: Enterprises are leery of exposing their sensitive and proprietary\\ndata on chain.\\nTo address the first three of these difficulties, developers can simply use a DON\\nas a secure middleware layer to enable enterprise systems to read from or write to\\nblockchains. The DON can abstract away detailed technical considerations such as\\ngas dynamics, chain reorganization, and so forth, for both developers and users. By\\npresenting a streamlined blockchain interface to enterprise systems, a DON can thus\\nconsiderably simplify the development of blockchain-aware enterprise applications, re-\\nmoving the burden from enterprises of acquiring or incubating blockchain-specific de-\\nvelopment resources.\\nSuch use of DONs is especially attractive in that it enables enterprise developers to\\ncreate smart-contract applications that are largely blockchain agnostic. As a result, the\\nlarger the set of blockchains for which a DON is instrumented to act as middleware, the\\nlarger the set of blockchains to which enterprise users can gain easy access. Developers\\ncan port applications from existing blockchains to new ones with minimal modification\\nto their internally developed applications.\\nTo address the additional problem of confidentiality, developers can appeal to the\\ntools we introduce in this paper and expect to deploy in support of DON applications.\\nThese include DECO and Town Crier Section 3.6.2 as well as confidentiality-preserving\\nAPI modifications discussed in Section 7.1.2 and a number of application-specific ap-\\nproaches covered in the remainder of this section. These DON systems can provide\\nhigh-integrity, on-chain attestations about enterprise system state without revealing\\nsensitive enterprise source data on chain.\\n4.3\\nDecentralized Identity\\nDecentralized identity is a general term for the notion that users should be able to\\nobtain and manage their own credentials, rather than relying on third parties to do\\nso. Decentralized credentials are attestations to attributes or assertions of the holder,\\nwhich are often called claims. Credentials are digitally signed by entities, often called\\nissuers, that can authoritatively associate claims with users. In most proposed schemes,\\nclaims are associated with a Decentralized Identifier (DID), a universal identifier for\\na given user. Credentials are bound to a public key whose private key the user holds.\\nThe user can thus prove possession of a claim using her private key.\\nVisionary as decentralized identity is, existing and proposed schemes, e.g., [14, 92,\\n129, 216], have three severe limitations:\\n• Lack of legacy compatibility: Existing decentralized identity systems rely on a\\ncommunity of authorities, called issuers, to produce DID credentials. Because\\nexisting web services do not generally digitally sign data, issuers must be launched\\nas special-purpose systems. Because there is no incentive to do this without a\\ndecentralized-identity ecosystem, a chicken-and-the-egg problem results. In other\\nwords, it’s unclear how to bootstrap an issuer ecosystem.\\n• Unworkable key management: Decentralized identity systems require users to\\nmanage private keys, something that experience with cryptocurrency has shown\\nto be an unworkable onus. It is estimated that some 4,000,000 Bitcoin have been\\nlost forever because of key management failures [194], and many users store their\\ncrypto assets with exchanges [193], thereby undermining decentralization.\\n• Lack of privacy-preserving Sybil resistance: A basic security requirement of ap-\\nplications such as voting, fair allocation of tokens during token sales, etc. is that\\nusers be unable to assert multiple identities. Existing decentralized identity pro-\\nposals require users to reveal their real-world identities in order to achieve such\\nSybil resistance, thereby undermining important privacy assurances.\\nIt is possible to address these problems using a combination of a committee of nodes\\nperforming distributed computation within a DON and the use of tools such as DECO\\nor Town Crier, as shown in a system called CanDID [160].\\nDECO or Town Crier can by design turn existing web services without modification\\ninto confidentiality-preserving credential issuers. They enable a DON to export relevant\\ndata for this purpose into a credential while concealing sensitive data that should not\\nappear in the credential.\\nIn addition, to facilitate key recovery for users, thus addressing the key-management\\nproblem, a DON can allow users to store private keys in secret-shared form. Users can\\nrecover their keys by proving to the nodes in the DON-similarly, using Town Crier or\\nDECO-an ability to log into accounts with a set of predetermined web providers (e.g.,\\nTwitter, Google, Facebook). The benefit of using Town Crier or DECO, as opposed to\\nOAUTH, is user privacy. Those two tools enable a user to avoid revealing to the DON\\na web provider identifier-from which real-world identities can often be derived.\\nFinally, to provide Sybil resistance, as shown in [160], it is possible for a DON to\\nperform a privacy-preserving transformation of unique real-world identifiers for users\\n(e.g., Social Security Numbers (SSNs)) into on-chain identifiers upon user registration.\\nThe system can thereby detect duplicate registrations without sensitive data such as\\nSSNs being revealed to individual DON nodes.7\\nA DON can provide any of these services on behalf of external decentralized identity\\nsystems on permissionless or permissioned blockchains, e.g., instances of Hyperledger\\nIndy [129].\\nExample application: KYC:\\nDecentralized identity holds promise as a means to\\nstreamline requirements for financial applications on blockchains while improving user\\nprivacy. Two challenges it can help address are accreditation and compliance obliga-\\ntions under anti-money-laundering / know-your-customer (AML / KYC) regulations.\\nAML regulations in many countries require financial institutions (and other busi-\\nnesses) to establish and verify the identities of individuals and businesses with which\\nthey perform transactions.\\nKYC forms one component of a financial institution’s\\nbroader AML policy, which also typically involves monitoring user behaviors and watch-\\ning fund flows, among other things.\\nKYC typically involves user presentation of identity credentials in some form (e.g.,\\nentry into an online web form, holding up an identity document in front of a user’s face\\nin a video session, etc.). Secure creation of and presentation of decentralized credentials\\ncould in principle be a beneficial alternative in several respects, namely by: (1) Making\\nthe KYC process more efficient for users and financial institutions, because once a\\ncredential is obtained, it could be presented seamlessly to any financial institution;\\n(2) Reducing fraud by reducing opportunities for identity theft through compromise\\nof personally identifiable information (PII) and spoofing during video verification; and\\n(3) Reducing the risk of PII compromise in financial institutions, as users retain control\\nof their own data.\\nGiven the multi-billion-dollar penalties paid by financial institutions for AML com-\\npliance failures, and the many financial institutions spending millions of dollars annu-\\nally on KYC, improvements could yield considerable savings for financial institutions\\nand, by extension, for consumers [196]. While the traditional financial sector is slow\\nto adopt new compliance tools, DeFi systems are increasingly embracing it [43].\\nExample application: Under-collateralized loans:\\nMost DeFi applications that\\nsupport lending today originate only fully collateralized loans. These are loans made\\nto borrowers who deposit cryptocurrency assets of value exceeding that of the loans.\\nInterest has arisen recently in what the DeFi community generally refers to as under-\\ncollateralized loans. These, by contrast, are loans for which the corresponding collateral\\nhas value that is less than that of the principal of the loan. Under-collateralized loans\\nresemble loans often made by traditional financial institutions. Rather than relying\\non deposited collateral as a guarantee of loan repayment, they instead base lending\\ndecisions on the credit histories of borrowers.\\n7This transformation relies on a distributed pseudorandom function (PRF).\\nUnder-collateralized loans constitute a nascent but growing part of the DeFi lend-\\ning market. They rely upon mechanisms like those employed by traditional financial\\ninstitutions, such as legal contracts [91]. An essential requirement for their growth\\nwill be the ability to furnish data on user creditworthiness-a key factor in conven-\\ntional lending decisions-to DeFi systems in a way that provides strong integrity, i.e.,\\nassurance of correct data.\\nA DON-enabled decentralized identity system would enable would-be borrowers to\\ngenerate high-assurance credentials attesting to their creditworthiness while preserving\\nthe confidentiality of sensitive information. Specifically, borrowers can generate these\\ncredentials based on records from authoritative online sources while exposing only the\\ndata attested to by the DON, without exposing other, potentially sensitive data. For\\nexample, a borrower can generate a credential indicating that her credit score with a\\nset of credit bureaus exceeds a particular threshold (e.g., 750), without revealing her\\nprecise score or any other data in her records. Additionally, if desired, such credentials\\ncan be generated anonymously, i.e., the user’s name can be treated as sensitive data\\nand itself not exposed to oracle nodes or in her decentralized credential. The credential\\nitself can be used on chain or offchain, depending on the application.\\nIn summary, a borrower can provide essential information to lenders on their credit\\nhistories with strong integrity and without risk of exposure of unnecessary, sensitive\\ndata.\\nA borrower can also provide a variety of other confidentiality-preserving credentials\\nhelpful in making lending decisions. For example, credentials can attest to a borrower’s\\npossession of (off-chain) assets, as we show in our next example.\\nExample application: Accreditation:\\nMany jurisdictions limit the class of in-\\nvestor to which unregistered securities may be sold. For example, in the U.S., SEC\\nRegulation D stipulates that to be accredited for such investment opportunities, an\\nindividual must possess a net worth of $1 million, meet certain minimum income re-\\nquirements, or have certain professional qualifications [209, 210]. Current accreditation\\nprocesses are cumbersome and inefficient, often requiring a letter of attestation from\\nan accountant, or similar evidence.\\nA decentralized identity system would enable users to generate credentials from\\nexisting online financial services accounts that prove compliance with accreditation\\nregulations, facilitating a more efficient and privacy-preserving KYC process.\\nThe\\nprivacy-preserving properties of DECO and Town Crier, moreover, would allow these\\ncredentials to be generated with a strong assurance of integrity without directly reveal-\\ning details of a user’s financial status. For example, a user could generate a credential\\nproving that she has a net worth of at least $1 million without revealing any additional\\ninformation about her financial status.\\n4.4\\nPriority Channels\\nPriority channels are a useful new service that is easy to build using a DON. Their\\ngoal is to deliver select, high-priority transactions in a timely way on MAINCHAIN\\nduring periods of network congestion. Priority channels may be viewed as a form of\\nfutures contract on block space and thus as a cryptocommodity, a term coined as part\\nof Project Chicago [61, 136].\\nPriority channels are intended specifically for miners to enable infrastructure ser-\\nvices, such as oracles, governance functions for contracts, etc.-not for ordinary user-\\nlevel activities such as financial transactions.\\nIn fact, as designed here, a priority\\nchannel implemented by less than 100% of the mining power in the network can only\\nprovide loose bounds on delivery times, preventing its use for highly speed-dependent\\ngoals such as front-running.\\nFigure 10: A priority channel is a guarantee by a miner M-or, more generally, a\\nset of miners M-to a user U that her transaction τ will be mined within D blocks\\nof inclusion in the mempool. A contract SC can use DON monitoring to enforce the\\nservice terms of the channel.\\nA priority channel takes the form of an agreement between a miner or set of miners\\n(or mining pools) M that provides the channel and a user U that pays a fee for access.\\nM agrees that when U submits a transaction τ to the mempool (with any gas price,\\nbut a pre-agreed-upon gas limit), M will place it on chain within the next D blocks.8\\nThe idea is depicted schematically in Fig. 10.\\nPriority-channel contract description:\\nA priority channel may be realized as a\\nhybrid smart contract roughly as follows. We let SC denote the logic on MAINCHAIN\\nand that on the DON by exec.\\nSC accepts a deposit / stake $d from M and an advance payment $p from U. A\\nDON executable exec monitors the mempool, triggering on placement of a transaction\\nby U. It sends a success message to SC if U submits a transaction that M mines in\\na timely way and a failure message in case of a service failure.\\nSC sends payment $p to M given a success message and sends all remaining funds,\\nincluding $d, to U if it receives a failure message. Upon successful termination, it\\nreleases deposit $d to M.\\nThe miner M can of course provide priority channels simultaneously to multiple\\nusers and can open a priority channel with U for a pre-agreed-upon number of messages.\\n4.5\\nConfidentiality-Preserving DeFi / Mixicles\\nToday, DeFi applications [1] provide little to no confidentiality for users: All transac-\\ntions are visible on chain. Various zero-knowledge-based approaches, e.g., [149, 217],\\ncan provide transaction privacy, and the TEF is general enough to support them. But\\nthese approaches are not comprehensive, and do not, for example, typically conceal the\\nasset on which a transaction is based.\\nThe broad set of computational tools we ultimately intend to support in DONs will\\nenable privacy in a number of different ways that can plug such gaps, helping comple-\\nment the privacy assurances of other systems. For example, Mixicles, a confidentiality-\\npreserving DeFi instrument proposed by Chainlink Labs researchers [135], can conceal\\nthe asset type backing a financial instrument, and fit very naturally into the DON\\nframework.\\nMixicles are most easily explained in terms of their use to realize a simple binary\\noption.\\nA binary option is a financial instrument in which two users, which we’ll\\nrefer to here for consistency with [135] as players, bet on an event with two possible\\noutcomes, e.g., whether or not an asset exceeds a target price at a predesignated time.\\nThe following example illustrates the idea.\\nExample 2. Alice and Bob are parties to a binary option based on the value of an asset\\ncalled Carol’s Bubble Token (CBT). Alice bets that CBT will have a market price of at\\nleast 250 USD at time T = noon on 21 June 2025; Bob bets the reverse. Each player\\ndeposits 100 ETH by a prespecified deadline. The player with the winning position\\nreceives 200 ETH (i.e., gains 100 ETH).\\n8D must of course be large enough to ensure that M can comply with high probability.\\nFor\\ninstance, if M controls 20% of the mining power in the network, it might choose D = 100, ensuring\\na failure probability of ≈2 × 10−10, i.e., less than one in a billion.\\nGiven an existing Chainlink oracle network O, it is easy to implement a smart\\ncontract SC that realizes the agreement in Example 2. The two players each deposit\\n100 ETH in SC. Sometime after T, a query q is sent to O requesting the price r of\\nCBT at time T. O sends a report r of this price to SC. SC then sends money to Alice\\nif r ≥250 and Bob if not. This approach, however, reveals r on chain-making it easy\\nfor an observer to deduce the asset underlying the binary option.\\nIn the terminology of Mixicles, it is helpful to think conceptually of the outcome\\nof SC in terms of a Switch that transmits a binary value computed as a predicate\\nswitch(r). In our example, switch(r) = 0 if r ≥250; given this outcome, Alice wins.\\nOtherwise switch(r) = 1 and Bob wins.\\nA DON can realize a basic Mixicle as a hybrid contract by running an executable\\nexec that computes switch(r) and reports it on chain to SC. We show this construction\\nin Fig. 11.\\nFigure 11: Diagram of basic Mixicle in Example 2. To provide on-chain secrecy for\\nreport r, and thus the asset underlying the binary option, the oracle sends to the\\ncontract SC via Switch only the binary value switch(r).\\nWe specify an adapter ConfSwitch in Appendix C.3 that makes it easy to achieve this\\ngoal in a DON. The basic idea behind ConfSwitch is quite simple. Instead of reporting\\nthe value r, ConfSwitch reports only the binary switch value switch(r).\\nSC can be\\ndesigned to make a correct payment based on switch(r) alone, and switch(r) by itself\\nreveals no information about the underlying asset-CBT in our example. Additionally,\\nby placing a ciphertext on (q, r) on the ledger encrypted under pkaud, the public key of\\nan auditor, the adapter ConfSwitch creates a confidentiality-preserving audit trail.\\nThe basic Mixicle we’ve chosen for simplicity to describe here conceals only the\\nasset and bet behind the binary option in our example. A full-blown Mixicle [135] can\\nprovide two forms of confidentiality. It conceals from observers: (1) What event the\\nplayers bet on (i.e., q and r) but also (2) Which player won the bet.\\nSince Mixicles are executed on MAINCHAIN, either one player would need to relay\\nswitch(r) from the DON to MAINCHAIN, or an executable exec could be created that\\nis triggered on output by ConfSwitch and calls another adapter to send switch(r) to\\nMAINCHAIN.\\nA third, subtle type of confidentiality is also worth considering. In a basic imple-\\nmentation of ConfSwitch, O is running the adapter on the DON and thus learns the\\nasset-CBT in our example-and thus the nature of the binary option. As discussed\\nin Appendix C.3, however, it is additionally possible to use DECO or Town Crier to\\nconceal even this information from O. In this case, the O learns no more information\\nthan a public observer of SC.\\nFor further details on Mixicles, we refer readers to [135].\\nFair Sequencing Services\\nOne important service that we expect DONs will offer that leverages their network-\\ning, computation, and storage capabilities is called Fair Sequencing Services (FSS).\\nAlthough FSS may be viewed simply as an application realized within the DON frame-\\nwork, we highlight it as a service that we believe will be in high demand across\\nblockchains, and which we expect the Chainlink network to support actively.\\nWhen executed on public blockchain networks, many of today’s DeFi applications\\nreveal information that can be exploited by users to their own benefit, analogous to\\nthe kind of insider leaks and manipulation opportunities that are pervasive in existing\\nmarkets [64, 155]. FSS instead paves the way toward a fair DeFi ecosystem. FSS\\nhelps developers to build DeFi contracts that are protected from market manipulation\\nresulting from information leakage. Given the problems we highlight below, FSS is\\nespecially attractive for layer-2 services and fits within the framework for such services\\nthat we discuss in Section 6.\\nThe challenge:\\nIn existing permissionless systems, transactions are ordered entirely\\nat the discretion of miners. In permissioned networks, the validator nodes may exert\\nthe same power. This is a form of largely unrecognized ephemeral centralization in\\notherwise decentralized systems. A miner can (temporarily) censor transactions for its\\nown benefit [171] or reorder them to maximize its own gain, a notion called miner-\\nextractable value (MEV) [90]. The term MEV is slightly deceptive: It does not refer\\nonly to value that miners can capture: Some MEV can be captured by ordinary users.\\nBecause miners have more power than ordinary users, however, MEV represents an up-\\nper bound on the amount of value any entity can obtain through adversarial reordering\\nand complementary transaction insertion. Even when miners order transactions simply\\nbased on fees (gas), without manipulation, users themselves can manipulate gas prices\\nto advantage their transactions over those of less sophistication.\\nDaian et al. [90] document and quantify ways in which bots (not miners) take\\nadvantage of gas dynamics in a way that harms users of DeFi systems today and how\\nMEV even threatens the stability of the underlying consensus layer in a blockchain.\\nOther examples of transaction-order manipulation surface regularly, e.g., [50, 154].\\nNew transaction-processing methods such as rollups are a very promising approach\\nto the scaling problems of high-throughput blockchains. They do not, however, address\\nthe problem of MEV. Instead, they shift it to the entity that generates the rollup. That\\nentity, whether the operator of a smart contract or a user furnishing a (zk-)rollup with\\na validity proof, has the power to order and insert transactions. In other words, rollups\\nswap MEV for REV: Rollup-Extractable Value.\\nMEV affects upcoming transactions that have been submitted to the mempool\\nbut are not yet committed on chain. Information about such transactions is broadly\\navailable in the network. Miners, validators, and ordinary network participants can\\ntherefore exploit this knowledge and create dependent transactions. In addition, min-\\ners and validators may influence the order of those transactions that they commit\\nthemselves and exploit this to their advantage.\\nThe problem of undue influence by leaders on transaction ordering in consensus\\nprotocols has been known in the literature since the 1990s [71, 190], but no satisfying\\nsolutions have been realized in practice so far [97].\\nThe main reason is that pro-\\nposed solutions-at least until very recently-cannot readily be integrated with public\\nblockchains, as they rely on the content of transactions remaining secret until after\\ntheir ordering has been determined.\\nFair Sequencing Services (FSS) overview:\\nDONs will provide tools to decentral-\\nize transaction ordering and implement it according to a policy specified by a relying\\ncontract creator, ideally one that is fair, and not advantaging actors who wish to\\nmanipulate transaction ordering. Collectively, these tools constitute FSS.\\nFSS includes three components. The first is monitoring of transactions. In FSS,\\noracle nodes in O both monitor the mempool of MAINCHAIN and (if desired) permit\\noff-chain submission of transactions through a specialized channel. The second is se-\\nquencing of transactions. The nodes in O order transactions for a relying contract\\naccording to a policy defined for that contract. The third is posting of transactions.\\nAfter the transactions are ordered, the nodes in O jointly send the transactions to the\\nmain chain.\\nThe potential benefits of FSS include:\\n• Order-fairness: FSS includes tools to help developers ensure that transactions\\ninput to a particular contract are ordered in a way that does not give an unfair\\nadvantage to well-resourced and/or technically savvy users. Ordering policies\\ncan be specified for this purpose.\\n• Reduction or elimination of information leaks: By ensuring that network partic-\\nipants cannot exploit knowledge about upcoming transactions, FSS can abate or\\neliminate attacks like front-running that are based on information available in\\nthe network before transactions are committed. Preventing exploitation of such\\nleakage ensures that adversarial transactions which depend on original pending\\ntransactions cannot enter the ledger before the original transactions are commit-\\nted.\\n• Reduced transaction cost: By eliminating players’ need for speed in submitting\\ntheir transactions to a smart contract, FSS can greatly reduce the cost of trans-\\naction processing.\\n• Priority ordering: FSS can automatically give critical transactions special priority\\nordering. For example, in order to prevent front-running attacks against oracle\\nreports, e.g., [79], FSS can insert an oracle report into a stream of transactions\\nretroactively.\\nAn overarching goal of the FSS in DONs is to empower DeFi creators to realize fair\\nfinancial systems, that is, systems that don’t advantage particular users (or miners)\\nover others on the basis of speed, insider knowledge, or ability to perform technical\\nmanipulation. While a crisp, general notion of fairness is elusive, and perfect fairness in\\nany reasonable sense is unachievable, FSS aims to provide developers with a powerful\\nset of tools so that they can enforce policies that help meet their design goals for DeFi.\\nWe note that while the main goal of FSS is to act as a fair sequencing service for\\nthe MAINCHAIN that DONs target, some of the same fairness desiderata that FSS\\nguarantees can also be appropriate for (decentralized) protocols that are run among\\nDON parties. Thus, FSS can be viewed more broadly as a service provided by a subset\\nof DON nodes to fairly sequence not only transactions sent by users of MAINCHAIN\\nbut also transactions (i.e., messages) shared among other DON nodes. In this section,\\nwe will focus primarily on the goal of sequencing MAINCHAIN transactions.\\nSection organization: In Section 5.1, we describe two high-level applications that mo-\\ntivate the design of FSS: preventing front-running of oracle reports and preventing\\nfront-running of user transactions. We then provide more details on the design of FSS\\nin Section 5.2. Section 5.3 describes examples of fair ordering guarantees and means\\nto achieve them. Finally, Section 5.4 and Section 5.5 discuss network-level threats to\\nsuch policies and means to address them, respectively for network flooding and Sybil\\nattacks.\\n5.1\\nThe Front-Running Problem\\nTo explain the goals and design of FSS, we describe two general forms of front-running\\nattacks and the limitations of existing solutions.\\nFront-running exemplifies a class\\nof transaction-ordering attacks: There are a number of related attacks such as back-\\nrunning and sandwiching (front-running plus back-running) [237] that we don’t cover\\nhere, but which FSS also helps address.\\n5.1.1\\nOracle Front-Running\\nIn their traditional role of providing off-chain data to blockchain applications, oracles\\nbecome a natural target for front-running attacks.\\nConsider the common design pattern of using an oracle to supply various price feeds\\nto an on-chain exchange: periodically (say every hour), the oracle collects price data for\\ndifferent assets and sends these to an exchange contract. These price-data transactions\\npresent obvious arbitrage opportunities: For example, if the newest oracle report lists\\na much higher price for some asset, an adversary could front-run the oracle report to\\nbuy up assets and immediately resell them once the oracle’s report is processed.\\nSpeed bumps and retroactive pricing:\\nA natural solution to the oracle front-\\nrunning problem is to give oracle reports special priority over other transactions. For\\nexample, oracle reports could be sent with high fees to encourage miners to process\\nthem first. But this will not prevent front-running if the arbitrage opportunity is high,\\nnor can it prevent arbitrage by the miners themselves.\\nSome exchanges have thus resorted to implementing more heavyweight “speed-\\nbumps,” such as queuing user transactions for a number of blocks before processing\\nthem, or retroactively adjusting prices when a new oracle report arrives. The disadvan-\\ntages of these solutions are that they add complexity to the exchange implementation,\\nincrease storage requirements and thus transaction costs, and disrupt the user experi-\\nence as asset exchanges are only confirmed after a significant time period.\\nPiggybacking:\\nBefore moving on to FSS, we discuss piggybacking, a quite simple and\\nelegant solution to the oracle front-running problem. It is not applicable to address\\nfront-running in other scenarios, however.\\nIn short, instead of periodically sending reports to the on-chain contract, oracles\\npublish signed reports that users append to their transactions when buying or selling\\non-chain assets. The exchange then simply checks that the report is valid and fresh\\n(e.g., the oracle can sign a range of blocks for which the report is valid), and extracts\\nthe relevant price feed from it.\\nThis simple approach has a number of advantages over the above “speed bump”\\napproach: (1) The exchange contract need not keep state of price feeds, which should\\nlead to lower transaction costs; (2) As oracle reports are posted on chain on a by-\\nneed basis, oracles can generate more frequent updates (e.g., every minute), thereby\\nminimizing arbitrage opportunities from front-running a report9; (3) Transactions can\\nbe validated immediately, as they always include a fresh price feed.\\nThe approach is not perfect, however. First, this piggybacking solution puts the\\nonus on the exchange’s users to fetch up-to-date oracle reports and attach them to their\\ntransactions. Second, while piggybacking minimizes arbitrage opportunities, it cannot\\nfully prevent them without affecting the liveness of the on-chain contract. Indeed, if an\\noracle report is valid until some block number n, then a transaction submitted to block\\nn + 1 would require a new valid report. Due to inherent delays in the propagation of\\nreports from oracles to users, the new report that is valid for block n + 1 would have\\n9Arbitrage is only worthwhile if the exploitable difference in asset prices exceeds the extraneous\\nfees required to buy and sell the assets, e.g., those collected by miners and the exchange.\\nto be publicized some period before block n + 1 is mined, say at block n −k, thereby\\ncreating a sequence of k blocks where a short-lived arbitrage opportunity exists. We\\nnow describe how FSS gets around these limitations.\\nPrioritizing oracle reports with FSS:\\nFSS can address the oracle front-running\\nproblem by building upon the above piggybacking solution, but pushing the additional\\nwork of augmenting transactions with oracle reports to the Decentralized Oracle Net-\\nwork.\\nAt a high level, oracle nodes collect transactions destined for an on-chain exchange,\\nagree on a real-time price feed, and post the price feed along with the collected trans-\\nactions to the main-chain contract. Conceptually, one can think of this approach as a\\n“data-augmented transaction batching”, where the oracle ensures that an up-to-date\\nprice feed is always added to transactions.\\nFSS solutions can be implemented transparently to the exchange’s users, and with\\nminimal changes to contract logic, as we describe in more detail in Section 5.2. Ensuring\\nthat fresh oracle reports are always prioritized over user transactions is just one example\\nof an ordering policy that FSS can adopt and enforce. Policies of FSS for ensuring order\\nfairness are described more generally in Section 5.3.\\n5.1.2\\nFront-Running User Transactions\\nWe now turn to front-running in generic applications, where the defense method above\\ndoes not work. The problem can be captured broadly through the following scenario:\\nAn adversary sees some user transaction tx1 sent into the P2P network and injects\\nits own adversarial transaction tx2, so that tx2 is processed before tx1 (e.g., by paying\\na higher transaction fee). For instance, this kind of front-running is common among\\nbots that exploit arbitrage opportunities in DeFi systems [90] and has affected users of\\nvarious decentralized applications [101]. Imposing a fair order among the transactions\\nprocessed on the blockchain addresses this problem.\\nMore fundamentally, seeing the details of tx1 is sometimes not even necessary and\\nknowledge of its mere existence may allow an adversary to front-run tx1 through its\\nown tx2 and defraud the innocent user that created tx1. For example, the user might\\nbe known to trade a particular asset at regular times. Preventing such attacks requires\\nmitigations that avoid leakage of metadata as well [62]. Some solutions for this problem\\nexist, but they introduce delays and usability concerns.\\nFrom network-order to finalized-order with FSS:\\nOpportunities for front-running\\narise because existing systems have no mechanisms to ensure that the order in which\\ntransactions appear on chain respects the order of events and the information flow\\noutside the network. This represents a problem arising from deficiencies in the imple-\\nmentation of applications (e.g., trading platforms) on a blockchain. Ideally, one would\\nensure that transactions are committed on the blockchain in the same order as they were\\ncreated and sent to the blockchain’s P2P network. But since the blockchain network\\nis distributed, no such order can be captured. FSS therefore introduces mechanisms\\nto safeguard against violations of fairness, which arise only because of the distributed\\nnature of the blockchain network.\\n5.2\\nFSS Details\\nFigure 12:\\nOrder-fair mempool with two different transaction paths:\\ndirect and\\nmempool-based.\\nFig. 12 shows a general schematic of the FSS. For ensuring fairness, the DON pro-\\nviding FSS must interfere with the flow of transactions as they enter MAINCHAIN.\\nAdjustments to clients, to smart contracts on MAINCHAIN, or to both may be neces-\\nsary. At a high level, processing of transactions by FSS can be decomposed into three\\nphases, described below: (1) Transaction monitoring; (2) Transaction sequencing; and\\n(3) Transaction posting. Depending on the ordering method used for transaction se-\\nquencing, additional protocol steps are needed, as described in the next section.\\n5.2.1\\nTransaction Processing\\nTransaction monitoring:\\nWe envision two different approaches for FSS to monitor\\nuser transactions destined for a specific smart contract, direct and mempool-based:\\n• Direct: The direct approach is conceptually simplest, but requires changes to\\nuser clients so that transactions are sent directly to the Decentralized Oracle\\nNetwork nodes, rather than to the nodes of the main chain. The DON collects\\nuser transactions destined to a specific smart contract SC and orders them based\\non some ordering policy. The DON then sends the ordered transactions to the\\nsmart contract on the main chain. Some ordering mechanisms also require the di-\\nrect approach because the user that creates a transaction must cryptographically\\nprotect it before sending it to FSS.\\n• Mempool-based: To facilitate the integration of FSS with legacy clients, the DON\\ncan use Mempool Services (MS) to monitor the main chain’s mempool and collect\\ntransactions.\\nDirect transmission is likely to be the preferred implementation for many contracts,\\nand we believe it should be fairly practical in many cases.\\nWe briefly discuss how existing DApps could be minimally modified to support\\ndirect transmission while preserving a good user experience. We describe approaches\\nusing Ethereum and MetaMask [6] since these are the most popular choices today, but\\nthe mentioned techniques should extend to other chains and wallets. A recent Ethereum\\nImprovement Proposal, “EIP-3085: Wallet add Ethereum chain RPC method” [100],\\nwill make it easy to target custom Ethereum chains (using a different CHAIN ID than\\nthat of MAINCHAIN to prevent replay attacks) from MetaMask and other browser-\\nbased wallets. After implementation of this proposal, a DApp seeking to use a DON\\nwould simply add a single method call to their front-end to be able to directly transmit\\ntransactions to any DON exposing an Ethereum-compatible API. In the meantime,\\n“EIP-712: Ethereum typed structured data hashing and signing” [49] provides a slightly\\nmore involved but already widely deployed alternative, where a DApp user can use\\nMetaMask to sign structured data specifying a DON transaction. The DApp can send\\nthis signed structured data to the DON.\\nFinally, we note that hybrid approaches are also possible.\\nFor example, legacy\\nclients can continue to send transactions into the main chain’s mempool, but critical\\ntransactions (e.g., oracle reports) are sent to DON nodes directly (in particular, the\\nset of nodes providing oracle reports such as price-feed updates and the set of nodes\\nproviding FSS may overlap or be identical).\\nTransaction sequencing:\\nThe main purpose of FSS is to guarantee that user trans-\\nactions are ordered according to a pre-defined policy. The nature of this policy will\\ndepend on the application’s needs and the types of unfair transaction orderings that it\\naims to prevent.\\nSince FSS on the DON is capable of processing data and maintaining local state,\\nthey may impose an arbitrary sequencing policy based on the information that is\\navailable at the oracles.\\nThe particular ordering policies and their implementation are discussed subse-\\nquently in Section 5.3.\\nTransaction posting:\\nAfter collecting and ordering user transactions, received ei-\\nther directly from users or collected from the mempool, the DON sends these trans-\\nactions to the main chain. As such, a DON’s interactions with the main chain remain\\nsubject to (potentially unfair) transaction ordering governed by the main chain’s min-\\ners. To harness the benefits of decentralized transaction ordering, the target smart\\ncontract SC thus has to be designed to treat the DON as a “first-class” citizen. We\\ndistinguish two approaches:\\n• DON-only contracts: The simplest design option is to have the main chain smart\\ncontract SC only accept transactions that have been processed by the DON. This\\nensures that the smart contract processes transactions in the order proposed by\\nthe DON, but de-facto restricts the smart contract to operating in a committee-\\nbased system (i.e., the DON committee now has ongoing power to determine the\\nordering and inclusion of transactions).\\n• Dual-class contracts: A preferred, more granular design has the main chain smart\\ncontract SC accept transactions originating both from the DON and from legacy\\nusers,10 but places traditional “speed bumps” on transactions that were not pro-\\ncessed by the DON. For example, transactions from the DON may be processed\\nimmediately, whereas legacy transactions get “buffered” by the smart contract for\\na fixed period of time. Other standard mechanisms for preventing front-running\\nsuch as commit-reveal schemes or VDFs [53] could also be applied to legacy\\ntransactions. This ensures that DON-ordered transactions do get processed in\\nthe order agreed upon, without giving the DON the unwanted power to censor\\ntransactions.\\nAs the imposition of transaction ordering by FSS requires that transactions are ag-\\ngregated “off-chain,” this solution is naturally combined with other aggregation tech-\\nniques that aim to reduce on-chain processing costs. For example, after collecting and\\nordering transactions, the DON may send these transactions to the main chain as a\\nsingle “batched transaction” (e.g., a rollup), thereby reducing the aggregate transaction\\nfee.\\nEnforcing the transaction order:\\nWhether in a DON-only or dual-class design,\\nthe main chain smart contract SC and the DON have to be co-designed so as to guar-\\nantee that the DON’s transaction ordering is upheld. Here also, we envision different\\ndesign options:\\n• Sequence numbers: The DON can append a sequence number to each transac-\\ntion, and send these transactions into the main chain’s mempool.\\nThe main\\n10If the DON’s transaction monitoring is based on the mempool, legacy transactions must be dis-\\ntinguishable from DON transactions so that they are not collected by the DON, e.g., via a special tag\\nembedded in the transaction or by specifying a particular gas price, e.g. DON transactions have gas\\nprices below a certain threshold.\\nchain smart contract SC ignores transactions that arrive “out-of-sequence.” We\\nnote that in this setting, the main-chain miners can decide to ignore the DON’s\\ntransaction ordering, thereby causing transactions to fail. It is possible by keep-\\ning (expensive) state for SC to enforce correct transaction ordering, somewhat\\nanalogously to how TCP buffers out-of-order packets until missing packets are\\nreceived.\\n• Transaction nonces: For many blockchains, and in particular for Ethereum, the\\nabove sequence-numbering approach can leverage built-in transaction nonces to\\nenforce that the main-chain smart contract SC processes transactions in sequence.\\nHere, the DON nodes send transactions to the main chain through a single main-\\nchain account, protected with a key shared among the DON nodes. The account’s\\ntransaction nonce ensures that transactions are mined and processed in the cor-\\nrect order.\\n• Aggregate transactions: The DON can aggregate multiple transactions in a rollup\\n(or in a bundle similar to a rollup). The main-chain smart contract needs to be\\ndesigned to handle such aggregate transactions.\\n• Aggregate transactions with a main chain proxy: Here, the DON similarly bun-\\ndles transactions into one “meta-transaction” for the main chain, but relies on a\\ncustom proxy smart contract to unpack the transactions and relay them to the\\ntarget contract SC. This technique can be useful for legacy compatibility. Meta-\\ntransactions act like rollups but differ in that they consist of an uncompressed\\nlist of transactions posted once to the main chain.\\nThe last design has the advantage of seamlessly supporting user transactions that\\nare themselves proxied through a main chain contract before reaching the DON’s target\\ncontract SC. For example, consider a user who sends a transaction to some wallet\\ncontract, which in turn sends an internal transaction to SC. Assigning a sequence\\nnumber to such a transaction would be tricky, unless the user’s wallet contract is\\nspecially designed to forward the sequence number with every internal transaction to\\nSC.\\nSimilarly, such internal transactions cannot be easily aggregated into a meta-\\ntransaction that is sent directly to SC. We discuss further design considerations for\\nsuch proxied transactions below.\\n5.2.2\\nTransaction Atomicity\\nOur discussion thus far has implicitly assumed that transactions interact with a single\\non-chain smart contract (e.g., a user sends a buy request to an exchange). Yet, in\\nsystems such as Ethereum, a single transaction can consist of multiple internal trans-\\nactions, e.g., one smart contract calling a function in another contract. Below, we\\ndescribe two high-level strategies for sequencing “multi-contract” transactions, while\\npreserving the atomicity of the transaction (i.e., the sequence of actions prescribed by\\nthe transaction are all executed in the correct order, or not at all).\\nStrong atomicity:\\nThe simplest solution is to apply FSS, as described above, di-\\nrectly to entire “multi-contract” transactions. That is, users send their transactions\\ninto the network and FSS monitors, sequences, and posts these transactions to the\\nmain chain.\\nThis approach is technically simple, but has one potential limitation: If a user\\ntransaction interacts with two contracts SC1 and SC2 that both want to leverage fair\\nsequencing services, then the sequencing policy of these two contracts has to be con-\\nsistent. That is, given two different transactions tx1 and tx2 that each interacts with\\nboth SC1 and SC2, it must not be the case that the policy of SC1 orders tx1 before tx2\\nwhereas the policy of SC2 prescribes the opposite order.\\nFor the vast majority of scenarios of interest, we envision that the sequencing poli-\\ncies adopted by different contracts will be consistent. For example, both SC1 and SC2\\nmay want transactions to be ordered by their approximate arrival time in the mempool,\\nand SC1 may further want certain oracle reports to always be delivered first. As the\\nlatter oracle report transactions do not interact with SC2, the policies are consistent.\\nWeak atomicity:\\nIn its full generality, FSS could be applied at the level of individual\\ninternal transactions.\\nConsider transactions of the form tx = { ˜txpre, ˜txSC, ˜txpost}, consisting of some initial\\ntransaction(s) ˜txpre, which results in an internal transaction ˜txSC to SC, which in turn\\nissues internal transaction(s) ˜txpost. The sequencing policy of SC might determine how\\nthe internal transaction ˜txSC has to be ordered with respect to other transactions sent\\nto SC, but leave open the sequencing order for ˜txpre and ˜txpost.\\nGiven the intrinsics of transaction processing in systems such as Ethereum, devel-\\noping a sequencing service that targets specific internal transactions is not straightfor-\\nward. With a specially designed contract SC, this may be realizable as follows:\\n1. The transaction tx is sent into the network and mined (without any sequencing\\nperformed by FSS). The initial ˜txpre is executed, and calls ˜txSC.\\n2. SC does not execute ˜txSC and returns.\\n3. FSS monitors internal transactions to SC, sequences them, and posts them back\\nto SC (i.e., by sending transactions ˜txSC directly to SC).\\n4. SC processes the transactions ˜txSC received from FSS, and issues internal trans-\\nactions ˜txpost that result from ˜txSC.\\nWith this approach, transactions are not executed fully atomically (i.e., the original\\ntransaction tx gets broken up into multiple on-chain transactions), but the ordering of\\ninternal transactions is preserved.\\nThis solution entails a number of design constraints. For example, ˜txpre cannot\\nassume that ˜txSC and ˜txpost will be executed. Moreover, SC should be designed so as to\\nexecute transactions ˜txSC and ˜txpost on behalf of a certain user, even though they were\\nsent by FSS. For these reasons, the more coarse-grained “Strong Atomicity” solution\\nabove is likely preferable in practice.\\nFor respecting more complex dependencies, involving multiple transactions and\\ntheir respective internal transactions, the transaction scheduler of FSS may contain\\nelaborate functions that resemble those found in transaction managers of relational\\ndatabase managers.\\n5.3\\nFair Transaction Sequencing\\nHere we discuss two notions of fairness for transaction sequencing and the correspond-\\ning implementations, which may be realized by FSS: order-fairness based on a policy\\nimposed by FSS and secure causality preservation, which requires additional crypto-\\ngraphic methods in FSS.\\nOrder-fairness:\\nOrder-fairness is a notion of temporal fairness in consensus protocols\\nthat has first been introduced formally by Kelkar et al. [144].\\nKelkar et al. aim to achieve a form of natural policy in which transactions are\\nordered based on the time they are first received by the DON (or the P2P network,\\nin the case of a mempool-based FSS). In a decentralized system, however, different\\nnodes may see transactions arrive in a different order.\\nEstablishing a total order\\non all transactions is the very problem solved by the consensus protocol underlying\\nMAINCHAIN.\\nKelkar et al. [144] therefore introduce a weaker notion that can be\\nachieved with the help of a Decentralized Oracle Network, called “block-order fairness.”\\nIt groups the transactions that the DON has received during a time interval into a\\n“block” and inserts all transactions of the block concurrently and at the same position\\n(i.e., height) into MAINCHAIN. They are thus ordered together and must be executable\\nin parallel, without creating any conflicts among them.\\nRoughly speaking, order-\\nfairness then states that if a large fraction of nodes see transaction τ1 before τ2, then\\nτ1 will be sequenced before or in the same block as τ2. By imposing such a coarse\\ngranularity on transaction order, the opportunities for front-running and other order-\\nrelated attacks are greatly reduced.\\nKelkar et al. propose a family of protocols called Aequitas [144], which address\\ndifferent deployment models, including synchronous, partially synchronous, and asyn-\\nchronous network settings. Aequitas protocols impose significant communication over-\\nhead relative to basic BFT consensus and are therefore not ideal for practical use.\\nWe believe, however, that practical variants of Aequitas will emerge that can be used\\nfor transaction sequencing in FSS and other applications. Some related schemes have\\nalready been proposed that have less accompanying formalism and weaker properties,\\ne.g., [36, 151, 236], but better practical performance. These schemes can be supported\\nin FSS as well.\\nIt is also worth noting that the term “fairness” appears elsewhere in the blockchain\\nliterature with a different meaning, namely fairness in the sense of opportunity for\\nminers proportional to their committed resources [106, 181] or for validators in terms\\nof equal opportunity [153].\\nSecure causality preservation:\\nThe most widely known approach to prevent front-\\nrunning and other ordering violations in distributed platforms relies on cryptographic\\ntechniques. Their common feature is to hide the transaction data itself, waiting until\\nthe order at the consensus layer has been established, and to reveal the transaction data\\nlater for processing. This preserves the causal order among the transactions that are\\nexecuted by the blockchain. The relevant security notions and cryptographic protocols\\nhave been developed considerably before the advent of blockchains [71, 190].\\nThe security conditions of “input causality” [190] and “secure causality preserva-\\ntion” [71, 97] require formally that no information about a transaction becomes known\\nbefore the position of this transaction in the global order has been determined. An ad-\\nversary must not be able to infer any information until that time, in a cryptographically\\nstrong sense.\\nOne can distinguish four cryptographic techniques to preserve causality:\\n• Commit-reveal protocols [29, 142, 145]: Instead of a transaction being announced\\nin the clear, only a cryptographic commitment to the transaction is broadcast. Af-\\nter all committed but hidden transactions have been ordered (in early blockchain\\nsystems on MAINCHAIN itself, but here by FSS), the sender must open the com-\\nmitment and reveal the transaction data within a predetermined time interval.\\nThe network then verifies that the opening satisfies the earlier commitment. The\\norigins of this method date prior to the advent of blockchains.\\nAlthough it is particularly simple, the approach introduces considerable draw-\\nbacks and is not easy to employ for two reasons. First, since only the commit-\\nment exists at the level of the ordering protocol, the semantics of the transaction\\ncannot be validated during consensus. An additional round-trip to the client\\nis required. More severely, though, weighs the possibility that no opening may\\never arrive, which could amount to a denial-of-service attack. Furthermore, it\\nis difficult to determine whether the opening is valid in a consistent, distributed\\nmanner because all participants must agree on whether the opening arrived in\\ntime.\\n• Commit-reveal protocols with delayed recovery [145]: One challenge with the\\ncommit-reveal approach is that a client may commit to a transaction specu-\\nlatively and reveal it later only if subsequent transactions make it profitable. A\\nrecent variant of the commit-reveal approach improves the resilience against this\\nkind of misbehavior. In particular, the TEX protocol [145] addresses this problem\\nusing a clever approach in which encrypted transactions include a decryption key\\nobtainable by computing a verifiable delay function (VDF) [53, 221]. If a client\\nfails to decrypt her transaction in a timely way, others in the system will decrypt\\nit on her behalf by solving a moderately hard cryptographic puzzle.\\n• Threshold encryption [71, 190]: This method exploits that the DON may perform\\nthreshold-cryptographic operations. Assume FSS maintains an encryption public\\nkey pkO and the oracles share the corresponding private key among themselves.\\nClients then encrypt transactions under pkO and send them to FSS. FSS orders\\ntransactions on the DON, then decrypts them, and finally injects them into\\nMAINCHAIN in the fixed order. Encryption therefore ensures that ordering is\\nnot based on the transaction content, but that the data itself is available when\\nneeded.\\nThis method was originally proposed by Reiter and Birman [190] and later re-\\nfined by Cachin et al. [71], where it was integrated with a permissioned consensus\\nprotocol. More recent work has explored the use of threshold cryptography as a\\nconsensus-level mechanism for generic messages [33, 97] and for general compu-\\ntations with shared data [41].\\nCompared to commit-reveal protocols, threshold encryption prevents simple denial-\\nof-service attacks (although care is required given the computational cost of de-\\ncryption). It lets the DON proceed autonomously, at its own speed and without\\nwaiting for further client actions. Transactions may be validated immediately af-\\nter they have been decrypted. Moreover, clients encrypt all transactions with one\\nkey for the DON and the communication pattern remains the same as with other\\ntransactions. Managing the threshold key securely and with changing nodes in\\nO, however, may pose additional difficulties.\\n• Committed secret sharing [97]: Instead of encrypting the transaction data under\\na key held by the DON, the client may also secret-share it for the nodes in O.\\nUsing a hybrid, computationally secure secret sharing scheme, the transaction\\nis encrypted first using a symmetric cipher with a random key. Only the corre-\\nsponding symmetric key is shared and the ciphertext is submitted to the DON.\\nThe client must send one key share to each node in O using a separately en-\\ncrypted message. The remaining protocol steps are the same as with threshold\\nencryption, except that the transaction data is decrypted with the symmetric\\nalgorithm after reconstructing the per-transaction key from its shares.\\nThis method does not require setup or management of a public-key cryptosystem\\nassociated with the DON. However, the clients must be aware of the nodes in\\nO and communicate in a secure context with each one of them, which places\\nadditional burden on the clients.\\nAlthough the cryptographic methods offer complete protection against information\\nleaking from submitted transactions to the network, they do not conceal metadata. For\\nexample, an IP address or an Ethereum address of the sender could still be used by\\nan adversary to perform front-running and other attacks. Various privacy-enhancing\\ntechniques deployed at the network layer, e.g., [52, 95, 107], or the transaction layer,\\ne.g., [13, 65], would be needed to accomplish this goal. The impact of a particular piece\\nof metadata, namely to which contract a transaction is sent, can be (partially) concealed\\nthrough multiplexing many contracts on the same DON. Cryptographic concealment\\nof transactions per se also doesn’t prevent prioritization of transactions by corrupted\\nDON nodes in collusion with transaction senders.\\nSecure causality as guaranteed by cryptographic protocols complement the order-\\nfairness guarantees for any policy, and we intend to explore a combination of the two\\nmethods, where this is possible. If an adversary cannot gain significant advantage from\\nobserving metadata, the secure causality-preservation protocols could be used alongside\\na na¨ıve ordering approach as well. For example, oracle nodes can write transactions\\nto L as soon as they receive them, without duplication. Transactions would then be\\nordered according to their appearance on L and subsequently decrypted.\\nWe also plan to consider the use of TEEs as a way to help enforce fair ordering; for\\nexample, Tesseract [44] may be viewed as achieving a form of causal ordering, but one\\nstrengthened by the ability of the TEE to process transactions in explicit form while\\nretaining their confidentiality.\\n5.4\\nNetwork-Layer Considerations\\nSo far, our description of FSS has mainly focused on the problem of enforcing that the\\nfinalized order of transactions matches their observed order in the network. Hereafter,\\nwe consider fairness issues that could arise at the network layer itself.\\nHigh-frequency traders in conventional electronic marketplaces invest considerable\\nresources to obtain superior network speed [64], and traders in cryptocurrency ex-\\nchanges exhibit similar behavior [90]. Network speed confers an advantage both in\\nobserving the transactions of other parties and in submitting competing transactions.\\nOne remedy deployed in practice and popularized in the book Flash Boys [155] is\\nthe “speed bump” introduced initially in the IEX exchange [128] and later in other\\nexchanges [179] (with mixed results [19]). This mechanism imposes a delay (350 mi-\\ncroseconds in IEX) on access to the market, with the aim of neutralizing advantages in\\nspeed. Empirical evidence, e.g. [128], supports its efficacy in decreasing certain trading\\ncosts for ordinary investors. FSS can be used simply to implement an asymmetrical\\nspeed bump-one that delays incoming transactions.\\nBudish, Cramton, and Shim [64] argue that exploitation of advantages in speed\\nis inescapable in continuous-time markets, and argue for a structural remedy in the\\nform of batch-auction-based markets. But this approach has not taken hold broadly\\nin existing trading platforms.\\nConventional trading systems are centralized, typically receiving transactions through\\na single network connection. In a decentralized system, by contrast, it is possible to\\nobserve transaction propagation from multiple vantage points. Consequently, it is pos-\\nsible to observe behaviors such as network flooding in a P2P network.\\nWe intend\\nto explore network-layer approaches to FSS that help developers to specify policies\\nprohibiting such undesirable network behaviors.\\n5.5\\nEntity-Level Fairness Policies\\nOrder-fairness and secure causality aim at enforcing an ordering on transactions that\\nrespects the time when they were created and first submitted to the network. A limita-\\ntion of this notion of fairness is that it does not prevent attacks in which an adversary\\ngains an advantage by flooding a system with many transactions, a strategy observed\\nin the wild as a way to perform effective transaction sniping in token sales [159] and to\\ncreate congestion resulting in liquidation of collateralized debt positions (CDPs) [48].\\nIn other words, order-fairness enforces fairness with respect to transactions, not players.\\nAs shown in the CanDID system [160], it is possible to use oracle tools such as DECO\\nor Town Crier in conjunction with a committee of nodes (such as a DON) to achieve\\nvarious forms of Sybil-resistance while protecting privacy. Users can register identities\\nand provide evidence of their uniqueness without disclosing the identities themselves.\\nSybil-resistant credentials offer a possible approach to enriching transaction-ordering\\npolicies in a way that would limit opportunities for flooding attacks. For example, a\\ntoken sale might permit only one transaction per registered user, where registration\\nrequires a proof of uniqueness of a national identifier, such as a Social Security Number.\\nSuch an approach isn’t foolproof, but may prove a useful policy to mitigate transaction-\\nflooding attacks.\\nThe DON Transaction-Execution Framework\\n(DON-TEF)\\nDONs will provide oracle and decentralized-resource support for layer-2 solutions within\\nwhat we call the Decentralized Oracle Network Transaction-Execution Framework (DON-\\nTEF) or TEF for short.\\nToday, the frequency of updates to DeFi contracts is limited by main chain latencies,\\ne.g., the 10-15 second average block interval in Ethereum [104]-as well as the cost of\\npushing large amounts of data on chain and limited computational/tx throughput-\\nmotivating scaling approaches such as sharding [148, 158, 232] and layer-2 execution [5,\\n12, 121, 141, 169, 186, 187]. Even blockchains with much faster transaction times,\\ne.g., [120], have proposed scaling strategies that involve off-chain computation [168].\\nTEF is meant to act as a layer-2 resource for any such layer-1 / MAINCHAIN systems.\\nUsing TEF, DONs can support faster updates in a MAINCHAIN contract while\\nretaining the key trust assurances provided by the main chain.\\nTEF can support\\nany of a number of layer-2 execution techniques and paradigms, including rollups,11\\noptimistic rollups, Validium, etc., as well as a threshold trust model in which DON\\nnodes execute transactions.\\nThe TEF is complementary to FSS and intended to support it. In other words, any\\napplication running in the TEF can use FSS.\\n11Often called “zk-rollups,” a misnomer, as they do not necessarily need zero-knowledge proofs.\\n6.1\\nTEF Overview\\nThe TEF is a design pattern for the construction and execution of a performant hybrid\\nsmart contract SC.\\nIn accordance with the main idea behind hybrid smart contracts, TEF involves a\\ndecomposition of SC into two pieces: (1) What we call in the TEF context an anchor\\ncontract SCa on MAINCHAIN and (2) DON logic exect that we call the TEF executable.\\nWe use SC here to denote the logical contract implemented by the combination of SCa\\nand exect.\\n(As noted above, we expect to develop compiler tools to decompose a\\ncontract SC automatically into these components.)\\nThe TEF executable exect is the engine that processes users’ transactions in SC. It\\ncan execute in a performant way, as it runs on the DON. It has several functions:\\n• Transaction ingestion: exect receives or fetches users’ transactions. It can do so\\ndirectly, i.e., through transaction submission on the DON, or via the MAINCHAIN\\nmempool using MS.\\n• Fast transaction execution: exect processes transactions involving assets within\\nSC. It does so locally, i.e., on the DON.\\n• Fast and low-cost oracle / adapter access: exect has native access to oracle reports\\nand other adapter data leading to, e.g., faster, cheaper, and more accurate asset\\npricing than MAINCHAIN execution. Moreover, off-chain oracle access reduces\\nthe oracle’s operational cost, hence the cost of using the system, by avoiding\\nexpensive on-chain storage.\\n• Syncing: exect periodically pushes updates from DON onto MAINCHAIN, updat-\\ning SCa.\\nThe anchor contract is the MAINCHAIN front end of SC. As the higher-trust com-\\nponent of SC, it serves several purposes:\\n• Asset custody: Users’ funds are deposited into, held in, and withdrawn from SCa.\\n• Syncing verification: SCa may verify the correctness of state updates when exect\\nsyncs, e.g., SNARKs attached to rollups.\\n• Guard rails: SCa may include provisions to protect against corruption or failures\\nin exect. (See Section 7 for more details.)\\nIn TEF, users’ funds are custodied on MAINCHAIN, meaning the DON is itself non-\\ncustodial. Depending on the choice of syncing mechanism (see below), users may need\\nto trust the DON only for accurate oracle reports and timely syncing with MAINCHAIN.\\nThe resulting trust model is very similar to that for order-book-based DEXes, e.g., [2],\\nwhich today generally include an off-chain component for order matching and an on-\\nchain component for clearing and settlement.\\nTo use the vocabulary of payment systems, one may think of exect as the component\\nof SC responsible for clearing, while SCa handles settlement. See Fig. 13 for a schematic\\ndepiction of TEF.\\nFigure 13: TEF schematic. In this example, transactions pass through the mempool\\nof MAINCHAIN via MS to the DON.\\nTEF benefits:\\nTEF carries three main benefits:\\n• High performance: SC inherits the DON’s much higher throughput than MAINCHAIN\\nfor both transactions and oracle reports. Additionally, exect can process transac-\\ntions faster and respond to oracle reports in a more timely way than an imple-\\nmentation on MAINCHAIN alone.\\n• Lower fees: The process of syncing is less time-sensitive than transaction pro-\\ncessing, and transactions can be sent from the DON to MAINCHAIN in batches.\\nConsequently, the per-transaction on-chain fees (e.g., gas costs) with this ap-\\nproach are much lower than for a contract that runs only on MAINCHAIN.\\n• Confidentiality: The confidentiality mechanisms of the DON can be brought to\\nbear on SC.\\nTEF limitations:\\nOne limitation of TEF is that it does not support instantaneous\\nwithdrawals, as they occur only on MAINCHAIN: Upon sending a withdrawal request\\nto SCa, a user may need to wait for exect to perform a state update that includes the\\nwithdrawal transaction before it can be approved. We discuss some partial remedies,\\nhowever, in Section 6.2.\\nAnother limitation of TEF is that it does not support atomic composition of DeFi\\ncontracts on MAINCHAIN, specifically the ability to route assets through multiple DeFi\\ncontracts in a single transaction. TEF can, however, support such atomicity among\\nDeFi contracts running on the same DON. We also discuss some ways to address this\\nproblem in Section 6.2.\\n6.2\\nTransaction Routing\\nTransactions for SC can be sent by users directly to the DON or can be routed through\\nthe mempool in MAINCHAIN (via FSS). There are four distinct transaction types, each\\nof which requires different handling:\\nWithin-contract transactions:\\nBecause it sidesteps the complications of gas dy-\\nnamics, TEF provides SC more flexibility in its handling of transactions than would be\\navailable in a layer-1 contract. For example, while a mempool transaction in Ethereum\\ncan be overwritten by a fresh transaction with a higher gas price, SC can treat a trans-\\naction that operates on assets within SC as authoritative as soon as it becomes visible\\nin the mempool. Consequently, SC need not wait for a transaction to be confirmed\\nwithin a block, resulting in considerably reduced latency.\\nProxying:\\nA user may wish to send a transaction τ to SC via a wallet contract or\\nother contract on MAINCHAIN. It is possible for the DON to simulate execution of\\nτ on MAINCHAIN to determine whether it results in a follow-on transaction to SC.\\nIf so, τ can be sequenced with other transactions for SC that do. There are a few\\npossibilities for how the DON identifies such transactions: (1) The DON can simulate\\nall transactions in the mempool (an expensive approach); (2) Certain contracts or\\ncontract types, e.g., wallets, can be listed for monitoring by the DON; or (3) Users can\\nannotate transactions for DON inspection.\\nMatters become more complicated when a single transaction interacts with two\\ncontracts, SC1 and SC2, both of which use Fair Sequencing Services and have incom-\\npatible ordering policies. The DON might, for example, sequence τ at the latest time\\nthat is compatible with both.\\nDeposits:\\nA transaction depositing a MAINCHAIN asset into SC needs to be con-\\nfirmed in a block before SC can treat it as valid. When it detects the mining of a\\ntransaction that sends assets (e.g., Ether) into SCa, exect can instantly confirm the\\ndeposit. For example, it can apply a current oracle-reported price on the DON to the\\nasset.\\nWithdrawals:\\nAs noted above, a limitation of TEF is that withdrawals cannot al-\\nways be executed instantaneously. In a rollup-type execution model, the withdrawal\\nrequest must be sequenced with other transactions, i.e., rolled up, in order to be safely\\nprocessed. There are, however, some partial remedies to this limitation.\\nIf the DON can quickly compute a rollup validity proof up to the withdrawal trans-\\naction, then observing a user’s transaction τ in the mempool exect can send a state-\\nupdate transaction τ ′ for τ at a higher gas price, a kind of beneficial front-running.\\nProvided that τ isn’t mined before τ ′ reaches the mempool, τ ′ will precede τ, and τ\\nwill effect an approved withdrawal.\\nIn a TEF variant where the DON is relied upon to compute state updates (see\\nthe threshold signing variant below), the DON can alternatively determine off-chain\\nwhether τ ought to be approved given the state of SC upon its execution. The DON\\ncan then send a transaction τ ′ that approves withdrawal τ-without effecting a full\\nstate update.\\nIf this approach isn’t possible, or in cases where it doesn’t succeed, a DON-initiated\\ntransaction τ ′ can send funds to the user in response to τ so that the user need not\\ninitiate an additional transaction.\\n6.3\\nSyncing\\nThe TEF executable exect periodically pushes updates from DON to MAINCHAIN,\\nupdating the state of SCa in a process we refer to as syncing. Syncing may be thought of\\nas propagation of layer-2 transactions to layer-1, so TEF can draw on any of a number\\nof existing techniques for this purpose, including rollups [5, 12, 16, 69], optimistic\\nrollups [10, 11, 141], Validium [201], or basic threshold signing, e.g., threshold BLS,\\nSchnorr, or ECDSA [24, 54, 116, 202]. In principle, trusted execution environments\\ncan also attest to the correctness of state changes, offering a much more performant\\nalternative to rollups, but with a hardware-dependent trust model. (See, e.g., [80].)\\nBelow we compare these syncing options with respect to three key properties in\\nTEF:\\n• Data availability: Where is the state of SC stored? At least three options are\\navailable in TEF: on the MAINCHAIN, on a DON, or by some third-party storage\\nproviders such as IPFS. They achieve different security guarantees, availability\\nlevels, and performance profiles. Briefly, storing state on the MAINCHAIN enables\\non-chain auditability and eliminates reliance on any party for state availability;\\non the other hand, storing state off-chain can reduce storage cost and improve\\nthroughput, at the cost of trusting storage providers (DON or third parties) for\\ndata availability. Of course, flexible models that combine these options are also\\npossible. We indicate the required form of data availability in Table 1.\\n• Correctness guarantees: How does SCa ascertain the correctness of the updates\\npushed by exect? This affects the computational load on exect and SCa and the\\nsyncing latency (see below).\\n• Latency: Syncing latency has three contributing factors: (1) The time taken\\nfor exect to generate a syncing transaction τsync; (2) The time taken for τsync\\nto be confirmed on MAINCHAIN; and (3) The time for τsync to take effect on\\nSCa. In TEF, latency is particularly important for withdrawals (but less so for\\nwithin-contract transactions) because withdrawals necessarily require an (at least\\npartial) state sync.\\nSyncing\\noptions\\nData\\navailability\\nCorrectness\\nguarantees\\nLatency\\nRollup [5, 12, 16, 69]\\nOn-chain\\nValidity proofs\\nTime taken to generate\\nvalidity proofs (e.g., min-\\nutes in current systems)\\nValidium [201]\\nOff-chain\\nValidity proofs\\nSame as above\\nOptimistic rollup [10,\\n11, 141]\\nOn-chain\\nFraud proofs\\nLength of the challenge\\nperiod\\n(e.g.,\\ndays\\nor\\nweeks)\\nThreshold signing [24,\\n54, 116, 202]\\nFlexible\\nThreshold signa-\\ntures by DON\\nInstantaneous\\nTrusted execution en-\\nvironments [80]\\nFlexible\\nHardware-based\\nattestations\\nInstantaneous\\nTable 1: Various syncing options in TEF and their properties.\\nTable 1 summarizes these properties in the five main syncing options in TEF. (Note\\nthat we do not intend to compare these technologies as standalone layer-2 scaling\\nsolutions. For that we refer readers to e.g., [121].)\\nNow we discuss each syncing option.\\nRollups:\\nA rollup [69] is a protocol in which the state transition effected by a\\nbatch of transactions is computed off-chain.\\nThe state change is then propagated\\nonto MAINCHAIN.\\nTo implement rollups, the anchor smart contract SCa stores a compact represen-\\ntation Rstate (e.g., a Merkle root) of the actual state. To sync, exect sends τsync =\\n(T, R′\\nstate) to SCa where T is the set of the transactions it processed since the last\\nsync and R′\\nstate is the compact representation of the new state calculated by applying\\ntransactions in T to the previous state Rstate.\\nThere are two popular variants that differ in how SCa verifies state updates in τsync.\\nThe first, (zk-)rollups, attach a succinct argument of correctness, sometimes called\\na validity proof, for the transition Rstate →R′\\nstate. To implement this variant, exect\\ncomputes and submits the validity proof (e.g., a zk-SNARK proof) along with τsync,\\nproving that R′\\nstate is the result of applying T to the current state of SCa. The anchor\\ncontract accepts the state update only after it has verified the proof.\\nOptimistic rollups do not include arguments of correctness, but have staking and\\nchallenge procedures that facilitate distributed verification of state transitions. For this\\nrollup variant, SCa tentatively accepts τsync assuming it is correct (hence the optimism)\\nbut τsync does not take effect until after a challenge period, during which any party\\nmonitoring MAINCHAIN can identify erroneous state updates and inform SCa to take\\nnecessary actions (e.g., to rollback the state and inflict a penalty on exect.)\\nBoth rollup variants achieve on-chain data availability, as transactions are posted\\non-chain, from which the full state can be constructed. The latency of zk-rollups is\\ndominated by the time needed to generate validity proofs, which typically is on the\\norder of minutes in existing systems [16] and will likely see improvements over time.\\nOptimistic rollups, on the other hand, have a higher latency (e.g., days or weeks)\\nbecause the challenge period needs to be long enough for fraud proofs to work. The\\nimplication of slow confirmation is subtle and sometimes specific to the scheme, so that\\na thorough analysis is out of scope. For instance, certain schemes consider payment\\ntransactions as “trustless final” [109] before the state update is confirmed, since a\\nregular user could verify a rollup much more quickly than the MAINCHAIN.\\nValidium:\\nValidium is a form of (zk-)rollup that makes data available off-chain only\\nand does not maintain all data on MAINCHAIN. Specifically, exect sends only the new\\nstate and the proof but not transactions to SCa. With Validium-style syncing, exect\\nand the DON that executes it are the only parties that store the complete state and\\nthat execute transactions. As with zk-rollups, syncing latency is dominated by validity\\nproof generation time. Unlike zk-rollups, however, Validium style syncing reduces the\\nstorage cost and increases the throughput.\\nThreshold signing by DON:\\nAssuming a threshold of DON nodes is honest, a\\nsimple and fast syncing option is to have DON nodes collectively sign the new state.\\nThis approach can support both on-chain and off-chain data availability. Note that if\\nusers trust DON for oracle updates, they do not need to trust it more for accepting\\nstate updates, as they are already in a threshold trust model.\\nAnother benefit of\\nthreshold signing is low latency. Support for new transaction signature formats as\\nproposed in EIP-2938 [70] and known as account abstraction would make threshold\\nsigning considerably easier to implement, as it would eliminate the need for threshold\\nECDSA, which involves considerably more complex protocols (e.g., [116, 117, 118])\\nthan alternatives such as threshold Schnorr [202] or BLS [55] signatures.\\nTrusted Execution Environments (TEEs):\\nTEEs are isolated execution environ-\\nments (usually realized by hardware) that aim to provide strong security protections\\nfor programs running inside. Some TEEs (e.g., Intel SGX [84]) can produce proofs,\\nknown as attestations, that an output is correctly computed by a specific program for\\na particular input12. A TEE-based variant of TEF syncing can be implemented by\\nreplacing proofs in (zk-)rollups or Validium with TEE attestations using techniques\\nfrom [80].\\nCompared to zero-knowledge proofs used in rollups and Validium, TEEs are much\\nmore performant. Compared to threshold signing, TEEs remove the complexity of\\ngenerating threshold ECDSA signatures as there need in principle be only one TEE\\ninvolved. Using TEEs does, however, introduce extra hardware-dependent trust as-\\nsumptions. One can also combine TEEs with threshold signing to create resilience\\nagainst compromise of a fraction of TEE instances, although this protective measure\\nreintroduces the complexity of generating threshold ECDSA signatures.\\nAdditional flexibility:\\nThese syncing options can be refined to provide more flexi-\\nbility in the following ways.\\n• Flexible triggering: TEF application can determine the conditions under which\\nsyncing is triggered. For example, syncing can be batch-based, e.g., occur after\\nevery N transactions, time-based, e.g., every 10 blocks, or event-based, e.g., occur\\nwhenever target asset prices move significantly.\\n• Partial syncing: It is possible and in some cases desirable (e.g., with rollups,\\npartial syncing can reduce latency) for exect to provide fast syncing of small\\namounts of state, performing full syncing perhaps only periodically. For example,\\nexect can approve a withdrawal request by updating a user’s balance in SCa\\nwithout otherwise updating MAINCHAIN state.\\n6.4\\nReorgs\\nBlockchain reorganizations resulting from network instability or even from 51%-attacks\\ncan pose a threat to the integrity of a main chain. In practice, adversaries have used\\nthem to mount double-spending attacks [34]. While such attacks on major chains are\\nchallenging to mount, they remain feasible for some chains [88].\\nBecause it operates independently of MAINCHAIN, a DON offers the interesting\\npossibility of observing and providing some protections against reorgs associated with\\nattacks.\\nFor example, a DON can report to a relying contract SC on MAINCHAIN the ex-\\nistence of a competing fork of some threshold length τ. The DON can additionally\\n12Supplementary details can be found in Appendix B.2.1. They are not required for understanding.\\nprovide proof-in either a PoW or PoS setting-of the existence of such a fork. The\\ncontract SC can implement suitable defensive actions, such as suspending further trans-\\naction execution for a period of time (e.g., to allow exchanges to blacklist double-spent\\nassets). Note that although an adversary mounting a 51%-attack can seek to censor\\nreports from a DON, a countermeasure in SC is to require periodic reports from the\\nDON in order to process transactions (i.e., a heartbeat) or to require a fresh report to\\nvalidate a high-value transaction.\\nWhile such forking alerts are in principle a general service the DON can provide\\nfor any of a number of purposes, our plan is to incorporate them with the TEF.\\nTrust Minimization\\nAs a decentralized system with participation from a heterogeneous set of entities, the\\nChainlink network provides strong protection against failures in both liveness (avail-\\nability) and safety (report integrity). Most decentralized systems, however, vary in\\nthe degree to which their constituent components are themselves decentralized. This\\nis true even of large systems, where limited decentralization among miners [32] and\\nintermediaries [51] has long been present.\\nThe goal of any decentralization effort is trust minimization: We seek to reduce the\\nadverse effects of systemic corruption or failure within the Chainlink network, even that\\ndue to a malicious DON. Our guiding principle is the Principle of Least Privilege [197].\\nSystem components and actors within the system should have privileges strictly scoped\\nto allow only for the successful completion of their assigned roles.\\nHere we lay out several concrete mechanisms for Chainlink to adopt in its drive\\ntoward ever-greater trust minimization. We characterize these mechanisms in terms\\nof the loci, i.e., system components, in which they are rooted, shown in Fig. 14. We\\naddress each locus in a respective subsection.\\n7.1\\nData-Source Authentication\\nCurrent operating models for oracles are constrained by the fact that few data sources\\ndigitally sign the data they omit, in large part because TLS does not natively sign\\ndata. TLS does make use of digital signatures in its “handshake” protocol (to establish\\na shared key between a server and client). HTTPS-enabled servers thus have certificates\\non public keys that can in principle serve to sign data, but they do not generally use\\nthese certificates to support data signing. Consequently, the security of a DON, as\\nin today’s oracle networks, relies on oracle nodes faithfully relaying data from a data\\nsource to a contract.\\nAn important long-term component of our vision for trust minimization in Chain-\\nlink involves stronger data-source authentication through support of tools and stan-\\ndards for data signing. Data signing can help enforce end-to-end integrity guarantees.\\nIn principle, if a contract accepts as input a piece of data D signed directly by a data\\nFigure 14: Loci of trust-minimizing mechanisms discussed in this section. 1⃝Data\\nsources provide data to the 2⃝DON, which relays a function of the data to a dependent\\n3⃝smart contract.\\nAdditionally, the DON or the oracle network includes 4⃝node\\nmanagement smart contracts on MAINCHAIN for, e.g., compensating nodes, guard\\nrails, and so forth.\\nsource, then the oracle network cannot feasibly tamper with D. Various encouraging\\nefforts to enable such signing of data have emerged, including OpenID Connect, which\\nis designed primarily for user authentication [9], TLS-N, an academic project aiming to\\nextend TLS [191] by repurposing TLS certificates, and TLS Evidence Extensions [63].\\nWhile OpenID Connect has seen some adoption, however, TLS Evidence Extensions\\nand TLS-N have yet to see adoption.\\nAnother potential avenue of data-source authentication is to use publishers’ own\\nSigned HTTP Exchanges (SXG) [230], which they can cache on content-delivery net-\\nworks as part of the Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) protocol [225]. The Chrome mo-\\nbile browser displays the content from AMP-cached SXGs as if they were served from\\ntheir publishers’ own network domains instead of the cache-server domain. This brand-\\ning incentive, coupled with the relative ease of enabling it using services like Cloud-\\nFlare’s Real URL [83] and Google’s amppackager [124], may lead to widespread adop-\\ntion of SXGs in cached news content, which would enable a simple, tamper-resistant\\nway for Chainlink oracles to trigger on newsworthy events reported in valid SXGs.\\nWhile AMP-cached SXGs from news publishers would not be useful for high-tempo\\napplications like reports on trading data, they could be a secure source for custom\\ncontracts pertaining to real-world events like extreme weather or election outcomes.\\nWe believe that simple deployment, mature tools, and flexibility will be vital to\\naccelerating data-source signing. Enabling data providers to use Chainlink nodes as\\nan authenticated API front end seems a promising approach. We intend to create an\\noption for nodes to function in this mode, with or without participation in the network\\nas a full-blown oracle. We refer to this capability as authenticated data origination\\n(ADO). By using Chainlink nodes with ADO, data sources will be able to benefit\\nfrom the experience and tools developed by the Chainlink community in adding digital\\nsigning capabilities to their existing suite of off-chain APIs. Should they choose to run\\ntheir nodes as oracles, they can additionally open up potential new revenue streams\\nunder the same model as existing data providers, e.g., Kraken [28], Kaiko [140], and\\nothers, that run Chainlink nodes to sell API data on chain.\\n7.1.1\\nThe Limitations of Authenticated Data Origination\\nDigital signing by data sources, while it can help strengthen authentication, isn’t suf-\\nficient per se to accomplish all of the natural security or operational goals of an oracle\\nnetwork.\\nTo begin with, a given piece of data D must still be relayed in a robust and timely\\nway from a data source to smart contract or other data consumer. That is, even in\\nan ideal setting in which all data is signed using keys pre-programmed into dependent\\ncontracts, a DON would still be needed to communicate the data reliably from sources\\nto contracts.\\nAdditionally, there are a number of cases in which contracts or other oracle-data\\nconsumers want access to authenticated output of various functions computed over\\nsource data for two main reasons:\\n• Confidentiality: A data source API may provide sensitive or proprietary data\\nthat needs to be redacted or sanitized before it is made publicly visible on chain.\\nAny modification to signed data, however, invalidated the signature. Put another\\nway, na¨ıve ADO and data sanitization are incompatible. We show in Example 3\\nhow the two can be reconciled through an enhanced form of ADO.\\n• Data source faults: Both errors and failures can affect data sources, and digi-\\ntal signatures address neither problem. From its inception [98], Chainlink has\\nalready included a mechanism to remediate such faults: redundancy. The re-\\nports issued by oracle networks typically represent the combined data of multiple\\nsources.\\nWe now discuss schemes we are exploring in the ADO setting to enhance the con-\\nfidentiality of source data and to combine data from multiple sources securely.\\n7.1.2\\nConfidentiality\\nData sources may not anticipate and make available the full gamut of APIs desired\\nby users.\\nSpecifically, users may wish to access pre-processed data to help ensure\\nconfidentiality. The following example illustrates the problem.\\nExample 3. Alice wishes to obtain a decentralized identity (DID) credential stating\\nthat she is over 18 years of age (and thus can, for instance, take out a loan). To do\\nso, she needs to prove this fact about her age to a DID credential issuer.\\nAlice hopes to use data from her state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)\\nwebsite for the purpose.\\nThe DMV has a record of her birthdate and will emit a\\ndigitally signed attestation A on it of the following form:\\nA = {Name: Alice, DoB: 02/16/1999}.\\nIn this example, the attestation A may be sufficient for Alice to prove to the DID\\ncredential issuer that she’s over 18. But it needlessly leaks sensitive information: Alice’s\\nexact DoB. Ideally, what Alice would like from the DMV instead is a signature on a\\nsimple statement A′ that “Alice is over 18 years of age.” In other words, she wants the\\noutput of a function G on her birthdate X, where (informally), A′ = G(X) = True if\\nCurrentDate −X ≥18 years; otherwise, G(X) = False.\\nTo generalize, Alice would like to be able to request from the data source a signed\\nattestation A′ of the form:\\nA′ = {Name: Alice, Func:G(X), Result: True},\\nwhere G(X) denotes a specification of a function G and its input(s) X. We envision\\nthat a user should be able to provide a desired G(X) as input with her request for a\\ncorresponding attestation A′.\\nNote that the data source’s attestation A′ must include the specification G(X) to\\nensure that A′ is correctly interpreted. In the above example, G(X) defines the meaning\\nof the Boolean value in A′ and thus that True signifies the subject of the attestation\\nis over 18 years of age.\\nWe refer to flexible queries in which a user can specify G(X) as functional queries.\\nIn order to support use cases like that in Example 3, as well as those involving queries\\ndirectly from contracts, we intend to include support for functional queries involving\\nsimple functions G as part of ADO.\\n7.1.3\\nCombining Source Data\\nTo reduce on-chain costs, contracts are generally designed to consume combined data\\nfrom multiple sources, as illustrated in the following example.\\nExample 4 (Medianizing price data). To provide a price feed, i.e., the value of one\\nasset (e.g., ETH) with respect to another (e.g., USD), an oracle network will generally\\nobtain current prices from a number of sources, such as exchanges. The oracle network\\ntypically sends to a dependent contract SC the median of these values.\\nIn an environment with data signing, a correctly functioning oracle network obtains\\nfrom data sources S = {S1, . . . , SnS} a sequence of values V = {v1, v2, . . . , vnS} from\\nnS sources with accompanying source-specific signatures Σ = {σ1, σ2, . . . , σnS}. Upon\\nverifying the signatures, it transmits the price v = median(V ) to SC.\\nUnfortunately, there is no simple way for an oracle network to transmit the median\\nvalue v in Example 4 to SC along with a succinct proof σ∗that v was correctly computed\\nover signed inputs.\\nA na¨ıve approach would be to encode in SC the public keys of all nS data sources.\\nThe oracle network would then relay (V, Σ) and allow SC to compute the median of V .\\nThis, however, would result in a proof σ of size O(nS)-i.e., σ∗would not be succinct.\\nIt would also incur high gas costs for SC, which would need to verify all signatures in\\nΣ.\\nUse of SNARKs, in contrast, enables a succinct proof of correctly combined au-\\nthenticated source values. It may be workable in practice, but imposes fairly high\\ncomputational costs on the prover, and somewhat high gas costs on chain. Use of\\nTown Crier is also a possibility, but requires the use of TEEs, which does not suit all\\nusers’ trust models.\\nA helpful concept in which to frame solutions to the general problem of signing com-\\nbined data from sources is a cryptographic tool known as functional signatures [59, 132].\\nBriefly, functional signatures allow a signer to delegate signing capability, such that\\nthe delegatee can only sign messages in the range of a function F chosen by the signer.\\nWe show in Appendix D how this functional constraint can serve to bound the range\\nof report values emitted by a DON as a function of the values signed by data sources.\\nWe also introduce a new primitive, called a discretized functional signature, that in-\\ncludes a relaxed requirement for accuracy, but is potentially much more performant\\nthan approaches such as SNARKs.\\nThe problem of combining data sources in a way that includes source authentication\\nof outputs also applies to data aggregators, e.g., CoinCap, CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko,\\nCryptoCompare, etc., which obtain data from a multiplicity of exchanges, which they\\nweight based on volumes, using methodologies that they in some cases make public\\nand are in other cases proprietary. An aggregator that wishes to publish a value with\\nsource authentication faces the same challenge as a collection of nodes aggregating\\nsource data.\\n7.1.4\\nProcessing Source Data\\nSophisticated smart contracts are likely to depend on custom aggregate statistics over\\nprimary data sources, such as volatility in recent price history over many assets, or\\ntext and photographs from news about pertinent events.\\nBecause computation and bandwidth are relatively cheap in a DON, these statistics-\\neven complex machine-learning models with many inputs-can be processed economi-\\ncally, as long as any output value destined for a blockchain is sufficiently concise.\\nFor computationally intensive jobs where DON participants may have differing\\nviews on complex inputs, extra rounds of communication between the DON partici-\\npants may be required to establish consensus on the inputs before computing the result.\\nAs long as the final value is fully determined by the inputs, once input consensus is es-\\ntablished each participant can simply compute the value and broadcast it to the other\\nparticipants with their partial signature, or send it to an aggregator.\\n7.2\\nDON Trust Minimization\\nWe envision two main ways of minimizing the trust placed in components of the DON:\\nfailover clients and minority reports.\\n7.2.1\\nFailover Clients\\nAdversarial models in the cryptography and distributed systems literature typically\\nconsider an adversary capable of corrupting (i.e., compromising) a subset of nodes,\\ne.g., fewer than one-third for many BFT protocols. It is commonly observed, however,\\nthat if all nodes run identical software, an adversary that identifies a fatal exploit could\\nin principle compromise all nodes more or less simultaneously. This setting is often\\nreferred to as a software monoculture [47].\\nVarious proposals for automatically diversifying software and software configura-\\ntions have been put forth to address the problem, e.g., [47, 113]. As noted in [47],\\nhowever, software diversity is a complex issue and requires careful consideration. Soft-\\nware diversification, for example, can result in worse security than a monoculture if it\\nincreases a system’s attack surface and thus its possible vectors of attack in excess of\\nthe security benefits it offers.\\nWe believe that support for robust failover clients-i.e., clients to which nodes\\ncan switch in the face of a catastrophic event-is an especially attractive form of\\nsoftware diversification. Failover clients do not increase the number of potential vectors\\nof attack, as they are not deployed as mainline software. They offer clear benefits,\\nhowever, as a second line of defense. We intend to support failover clients in DONs as\\na key means of reducing their dependence for security on a single client.\\nChainlink already has in place a robust system of failover clients. Our approach\\ninvolves maintaining previous, battle-tested client versions. Today, for example, Chain-\\nlink nodes with Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) as their primary client include support\\nfor Chainlink’s previous FluxMonitor system if needed. Having been in use for some\\ntime, FluxMonitor has received security audits and field testing. It provides the same\\nfunctionality as OCR, just at higher cost-a cost only incurred on an as-needed basis.\\n7.2.2\\nMinority Reports\\nGiven a sufficiently large minority set Ominority-a fraction of honest nodes that ob-\\nserve malfeasance by the majority-it can be helpful for them to generate a minority\\nreport. This is a parallel report or flag, relayed to a dependent contract SC on-chain\\nby Ominority. SC can make use of this flag according to its own contract-specific policy.\\nFor example, for a contract in which safety is more important than liveness or respon-\\nsiveness, a minority report might cause the contract to request supplementary reports\\nfrom another DON, or trigger a circuit breaker (see the next section).\\nMinority reports can play an important role even when the majority is honest,\\nbecause any report-aggregation scheme, even if it uses functional signatures, must\\noperate in a threshold manner, to ensure resilience against oracle or data failure. In\\nother words, it must be possible to produce a valid report based on the inputs of\\nkS < nS oracles, for some threshold kS.\\nThis means a corrupted DON has some\\nlatitude in manipulating report values by selecting its preferred kS values among the\\nnS reported in V by the full set of oracles, even if all sources are honest.\\nFor example, suppose that nS = 10 and kS = 7 in a system that uses a functional\\nsignature to authenticate computation of median over V for the USD price of ETH.\\nSuppose that five sources report a price of $500, while the other five report $1000.\\nThen by medianizing the lowest 7 reports, the DON can output a valid value v = $500,\\nand by medianizing the highest, it can output v = $1000.\\nBy enhancing the DON protocol so that all nodes are aware of which data was\\navailable, and which data was used to construct a report, nodes could detect and flag\\nstatistically significant tendencies to favor one set of reports over another, and produce\\na minority report as a result.\\n7.3\\nGuard Rails\\nOur trust model for DONs treats MAINCHAIN as a higher-security, higher-privilege\\nsystem than DONs. (While this trust model may not always hold true, it is easier\\nto adapt the resulting mechanism to situations where the DON is the higher security\\nplatform than vice versa.)\\nA natural trust minimization strategy thus involves the implementation of moni-\\ntoring and failsafe mechanisms in smart contracts-either in a MAINCHAIN front end\\nfor a DON or directly in a dependent contract SC. We refer to these mechanisms as\\nguard rails, and enumerate some of the most important here:\\n• Circuit breakers: SC may pause or halt state updates as a function either of char-\\nacteristics of the state updates themselves (e.g., large variance across sequential\\nreports) or based on other inputs. For example, a circuit breaker might trip in\\ncases where oracle reports vary implausibly over time. A circuit breaker might\\nalso be tripped by a minority report. Thus, circuit breakers can prevent DONs\\nfrom making grossly erroneous reports.\\nCircuit breakers can provide time for additional interventions to be considered\\nor exercised. One such intervention is escape hatches.\\n• Escape hatches: Under adverse circumstances, as identified by a set of custodi-\\nans, community token holders, or other bodies of trustees, a contract may invoke\\nan emergency facility sometimes called an escape hatch [163]. An escape hatch\\ncauses SC to shut down in some manner and/or terminates pending and possibly\\nfuture transactions. For example, it may return custodied funds to users [17]),\\nmay terminate contract terms [162], or may cancel pending and/or future trans-\\nactions [173]. Escape hatches can be deployed in any type of contract, not just\\none that relies on a DON, but they are of interest as a potential buffer against\\nDON malfeasance.\\n• Failover: In systems where SC relies on the DON for essential services, it is pos-\\nsible for SC to provide failover mechanisms that ensure service continuation even\\nin the case of DON failure or misbehavior. For example, in the TEF (Section 6),\\nthe anchor contract SCa may provide dual interfaces where both on-chain and\\noff-chain execution interfaces are supported for certain critical operations (e.g.,\\nwithdrawal), or for ordinary transactions, with a suitable delay to prevent front-\\nrunning of DON transactions. In cases where data sources sign data, users could\\nalso furnish reports to SCa when the DON fails to do so.\\nFraud proofs, as proposed for various forms of optimistic rollup (see Section 6.3),\\nare similar in flavor and complementary to the mechanisms we enumerate above. They\\ntoo provide a form of on-chain monitoring and protection against potential failures in\\noff-chain system components.\\n7.4\\nTrust-Minimized Governance\\nLike all decentralized systems, the Chainlink network requires governance mechanisms\\nto adjust parameters over time, respond to emergencies, and guide its evolution.\\nSome of these mechanisms currently reside on MAINCHAIN, and may continue to\\ndo so even with the deployment of DONs. One example is the payment mechanism\\nfor oracle node providers (DON nodes). DON front end contracts on MAINCHAIN\\ncontain additional mechanisms, such as guard rails, that may be subject to periodic\\nmodification.\\nWe foresee two classes of governance mechanisms: evolutionary and emergency.\\nEvolutionary governance:\\nMany modifications to the Chainlink ecosystem are\\nsuch that their implementation is not a matter of urgency: Performance improvements,\\nfeature enhancements, (non-urgent) security upgrades, and so forth. As Chainlink pro-\\ngressively moves toward even more participants in its governance, we expect many or\\nmost such changes to be ratified by the community of a specific DON affected by those\\nchanges. In the interim, and perhaps ultimately as a parallel mechanism, we believe\\nthat a notion of temporal least privilege can be a useful means of implementing evolu-\\ntionary governance. Very simply, the idea is for changes to deploy gradually, ensuring\\nthe community an opportunity to respond to them. For example, migration to a new\\nMAINCHAIN contract can be constrained so that the new contract must be deployed\\nat least thirty days before activation.\\nEmergency governance:\\nExploitable or exploited vulnerabilities in MAINCHAIN\\ncontracts or other forms of liveness or safety failures may require immediate interven-\\ntion to ensure against catastrophic outcomes. Our intention is to support a multisig\\nintervention mechanism in which, to ensure against malfeasance by any organization,\\nsigners will be dispersed across organizations. Ensuring consistent availability of signers\\nand timely access to appropriate chains of command for authorization of emergency\\nchanges will clearly require careful operational planning and regular review. These\\nchallenges are similar to those involved in testing other cybersecurity incident-response\\ncapabilities [134], with a similar need to combat common problems like vigilance decre-\\nment [223].\\nThe governance of DONs differs from that of many decentralized systems in its\\npotential degree of heterogeneity. Each DON may have distinct data sources, executa-\\nbles, service-level requirements such as uptime, and users. The Chainlink network’s\\ngovernance mechanisms must be flexible enough to accommodate such variations in\\noperational goals and parameters. We are actively exploring design ideas and plan to\\npublish research on this topic in the future.\\n7.5\\nPublic-Key Infrastructure\\nWith progressive decentralization will come the need for a robust identification of\\nnetwork participants, including DON nodes. In particular, Chainlink requires a strong\\nPublic-Key Infrastructure (PKI). A PKI is a system that binds keys to identities. For\\nexample, a PKI undergirds the Internet’s system of secure connections (TLS): When\\nyou connect to a website via HTTPS (e.g., https://www.chainlinklabs.com) and a\\nlock appears in your browser, that means that the public key of the domain owner has\\nbeen bound to that owner by an authority-specifically, through a digital signature in\\na so-called certificate. A hierarchical system of certificate authorities (CAs), whose top-\\nlevel root authorities are hardwired into popular browsers, helps ensure that certificates\\nare issued only to the legitimate owners of domains.\\nWe expect that Chainlink will eventually make use of decentralized name services,\\ninitially the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) [22], as the foundation for our PKI. As\\nits name suggests, ENS is analogous to DNS, the Domain Name System that maps\\n(human-readable) domain names to IP addresses on the internet. ENS, however, in-\\nstead maps human-readable Ethereum names to blockchain addresses. Because ENS\\noperates on the Ethereum blockchain, barring key compromise, tampering with its\\nnamespace is in principle as difficult as tampering with the contract administering it\\nand/or the underlying blockchain. (DNS, in contrast, has historically been vulnerable\\nto spoofing, hijacking, and other attacks.)\\nWe have registered data.eth with ENS on the Ethereum mainnet, and intend to\\nestablish it as a root namespace under which the identities of oracle data services and\\nother Chainlink network entities reside.\\nDomains in ENS are hierarchical, meaning that each domain may contain references\\nto other names under it. Subdomains in ENS can serve as a way to organize and\\ndelegate trust.\\nThe main role of data.eth will be to serve as an on-chain directory service for\\ndata feeds. Traditionally, developers and users of oracles have used off-chain sources\\n(e.g., websites like docs.chain.link or data.chain.link, or social networks such as\\nTwitter) to publish and obtain oracle data feed addresses (such as the ETH-USD price\\nfeed). With a highly trustworthy root namespace such as data.eth, it is possible in-\\nstead to establish a mapping of eth-usd.data.eth to, e.g., the smart contract address\\nof an on-chain oracle network aggregator for the ETH-USD price feed. This would\\ncreate a secure path for anyone to refer to the blockchain as the source of truth for\\nthat data feed of that price/name pair (ETH-USD). Consequently, such use of ENS\\nrealizes two benefits unavailable in off-chain data sources:\\n• Strong security: All changes and updates to the domain are recorded immutably\\nand secured cryptographically, as opposed to text addresses on a website, which\\nenjoy neither of these two security properties.\\n• Automated on-chain propagation: Updates to the underlying address of a data-\\nfeed’s smart contract can trigger notifications that propagate to dependent smart\\ncontracts and can, for example, automatically update dependent contracts with\\nthe new addresses.13\\nNamespaces like ENS, however, do not automatically validate legitimate ownership\\nof asserted names. Thus, for example, if the namespace includes the entry\\n⟨“Acme Oracle Node Co.”, addr⟩,\\nthen a user obtains the assurance that addr belongs to the claimant of the name Acme\\nOracle Node Co. Without additional mechanisms around namespace administration,\\nhowever, she does not obtain assurance that the name belongs to an entity legitimately\\ncalled Acme Oracle Node Co. in a meaningful real world sense.\\nOur approach to validation of names, i.e., ensuring their ownership by correspond-\\ning, legitimate real-world entities, relies on several components. Today, Chainlink Labs\\neffectively acts as a CA for the Chainlink network. While Chainlink Labs will continue\\nto validate names, our PKI will evolve into a more decentralized model in two ways:\\n• Web-of-trust model: The decentralized counterpart of a hierarchical PKI is of-\\nten referred to as a web-of-trust.14 Variants have been proposed since the 1990s,\\ne.g., [98], and a number of researchers have observed that blockchains can facil-\\nitate use of the idea, e.g., [227] by recording certificates in a globally consistent\\nledger. We are exploring variants of this model to validate the identities of entities\\nin the Chainlink network in a more decentralized way.\\n13A dependent contract can optionally include a predetermined delay to allow for manual inspection\\nand intervention by dependent-contract administrators.\\n14A term coined by Phil Zimmermann for PGP [238].\\n• Linkage to validating data: Today, a substantial amount of oracle node perfor-\\nmance data is visible on-chain, and thus archivally bound to node addresses.\\nSuch data may be viewed as enriching an identity in the PKI by providing his-\\ntorical evidence of its (reliable) participation in the network. Additionally, tools\\nfor decentralized identity based on DECO and Town Crier [160] enable nodes\\nto accumulate credentials derived from real-world data. As just one example, a\\nnode operator can attach a credential to its PKI identity that proves possession\\nof a Dun and Bradstreet rating. These supplementary forms of validation can\\nsupplement staking in creating assurance of the security of the network. An or-\\nacle node with an established real-world identity may be viewed as having stake\\nin a system deriving from its reputation. (See Section 4.3 and Section 9.6.3.)\\nA final requirement for the Chainlink PKI is secure bootstrapping, i.e., securely\\npublishing the root name for the Chainlink network, currently data.eth (analogously\\nto hardwiring of top-level domains in browsers). In other words, how do Chainlink users\\ndetermine that data.eth is indeed the top-level domain associated with the Chainlink\\nproject? The solution to this problem for the Chainlink network is multi-pronged and\\nmay involve:\\n• Adding a TXT record [224] to our domain record for chain.link that specifies\\ndata.eth as the root domain for the Chainlink ecosystem. (Chainlink thus im-\\nplicitly leverages the PKI for internet domains to validate its root ENS domain.)\\n• Linking to data.eth from Chainlink’s existing website, e.g., from\\nhttps://docs.chain.link. (Another implicit use of the PKI for internet do-\\nmains.)\\n• Making the use of data.eth known via various documents, including this whitepa-\\nper.\\n• Posting data.eth publicly on our social-media channels, such as Twitter, and\\nthe Chainlink blog [18].\\n• Placing a large quantity of LINK under the control of the same registrant address\\nas data.eth.\\nDON Deployment Considerations\\nWhile not a part of our core design, there are several important technical considerations\\nin the realization of DONs that deserve treatment here.\\n8.1\\nRollout Approach\\nThis paper lays out an ambitious vision of advanced Chainlink functionality whose\\nrealization will require solutions to many challenges along the way. This whitepaper\\nidentifies some challenges, but unanticipated ones are sure to arise.\\nWe plan to implement elements of this vision in an incremental fashion over an\\nextended period of time.\\nOur expectation is that DONs will initially launch with\\nsupport for specific pre-built components built collaboratively by teams within the\\nChainlink community. The intention is that broader uses of DONs, e.g., the ability to\\nlaunch arbitrary executables, will see support at a later time.\\nOne reason for such caution is that composition of smart contracts can have com-\\nplex, unintended, and dangerous side effects, as recent flash-loan-based attacks have\\nfor instance shown [127, 189]. Similarly, composition of smart contracts, adapters, and\\nexecutables will require extreme care.\\nIn our initial deployment of DONs, we plan to include only a pre-built set of tem-\\nplatized executables and adapters. This will enable study of the compositional security\\nof these functionalities using formal methods [46, 170] and other approaches. It will\\nalso simplify pricing: Functionality pricing can be established by DON nodes on a per-\\nfunctionality basis, rather than through generalized metering, an approach adopted\\nin, e.g., [156]. We also expect the Chainlink community to take part in the creation\\nof additional templates, combining various adapters and executables into increasingly\\nuseful decentralized services that can be run by hundreds, if not thousands of individual\\nDONs.\\nAdditionally, this approach can help prevent state bloat, i.e., the need for DON\\nnodes to retain an unworkable amount of state in working memory. This problem is\\nalready arising in permissionless blockchains, motivating approaches such as “stateless\\nclients” (see, e.g., [206]). It can be more acute in higher throughput systems, motivating\\nan approach in which a DON deploys only state-size-optimized executables.\\nAs DONs evolve and mature and include robust guard rails, as discussed in Sec-\\ntion 7, cryptoeconomic and reputation-based security mechanisms as discussed in Sec-\\ntion 9, and other features that provide a high degree of assurance for DON users, we\\nalso expect to develop a framework and tools to facilitate broader launch and use of\\nDONs by the community. Ideally, these tools will enable a collection of node operators\\nto come together as an oracle network and launch their own DONs in a permissionless\\nor self-service manner, meaning that they can do so unilaterally.\\n8.2\\nDynamic DON Membership\\nThe set of nodes running a given DON may change over time. There are two approaches\\nto key management for skL given dynamic membership in O.\\nThe first is to update shares of skL held by the nodes upon changes in membership,\\nwhile keeping pkL unchanged. This approach, explored in [41, 161, 198], has the merit\\nof not requiring that relying parties update pkL.\\nThe classical technique of share resharing, introduced in [122], provides a simple\\nand efficient way of realizing such share updates. It enables a secret to be transferred\\nbetween one set of nodes O(1) and a second, possibly intersecting one O(2). In this\\napproach, each node O(1)\\ni\\nperforms a (k(2), n(2)) secret sharing of its secret share across\\nnodes in O(2) for n(2) = |O(2)| and desired (possibly new) threshold k(2). Various verifi-\\nable secret sharing (VSS) schemes [108] can provide security against an adversary that\\nactively corrupts nodes, i.e., introduces malicious behavior into the protocol. Tech-\\nniques in [161] aim to do so while reducing communication complexity and providing\\nresilience against failures in cryptographic hardness assumptions.\\nA second approach is to update the ledger key pkL. This has the benefit of forward\\nsecurity: Compromise of old shares of pkL (i.e., former committee nodes) would not\\nresult in compromise of the current key. Updates to pkL, however, carry two drawbacks:\\n(1) Data encrypted under pkL needs to be re-encrypted during a key refresh and (2)\\nKey updates need to be propagated to relying parties.\\nWe intend to explore both approaches, as well as hybridizations of the two.\\n8.3\\nDON Accountability\\nAs with existing Chainlink oracle networks, DONs will include mechanisms for account-\\nability, i.e., recording, monitoring, and enforcing correct node behavior. DONs will have\\nmuch more substantial data capacity than many existing permissionless blockchains,\\nparticularly given their ability to connect to external decentralized storage. Conse-\\nquently, they will be able to record nodes’ performance history in detail, allowing for\\nmore fine-grained accountability mechanisms. For example, off-chain computation of\\nasset prices may involve inputs that are discarded before a median result is sent on\\nchain. In a DON, these intermediate results could be recorded. Misbehavior or per-\\nformance lapses by individual nodes in a DON can thus be remedied or penalized on\\nthe DON in a fine-grained way. We have additionally discussed approaches to building\\nguard rails in Section 7.3 that address the contract-specific impact of systemic failures.\\nIt is also important, however, to have failsafe mechanisms for DONs themselves,\\ni.e., protections against systemic, potentially catastrophic DON failures, specifically\\nforking / equivocation and service-level agreement (SLA) failures, as we now explain.\\nForking / equivocation:\\nGiven sufficiently many faulty nodes, a DON can fork\\nor equivocate, producing two distinct, inconsistent blocks or sequences of blocks in L.\\nBecause a DON digitally signs the contents of L, however, it is possible to leverage a\\nmain chain MAINCHAIN to prevent and/or penalize equivocation.\\nThe DON can periodically checkpoint state from L in an audit contract on MAINCHAIN.\\nIf its future state deviates from a checkpointed state, a user / auditor can present proof\\nof this misbehavior to the audit contract. Such proof can be used to generate an alert\\nor penalize DON nodes via slashing in the contract. This latter approach introduces\\nan incentive design problem similar to that for specific oracle feeds, and can build on\\nour work outlined in Section 9.\\nEnforcing service-level agreements:\\nWhile DONs are not necessarily meant to\\nrun indefinitely, it is important that they adhere to service level agreements (SLAs)\\nwith their users. Basic SLA enforcement is possible on a main chain. For example,\\nDON nodes might commit to maintaining the DON until a certain date, or to provid-\\ning advance notice of service termination (e.g., three months’ notice). A contract on\\nMAINCHAIN can provide basic cryptoeconomic SLA enforcement.\\nFor example, the SLA contract can slash DON-deposited funds if checkpoints are\\nnot provided at required intervals. A user can deposit funds and challenge the DON\\nto prove that a checkpoint correctly represents a sequence of valid blocks (in a manner\\nanalogous to, e.g. [141]). Of course, block production does not equate with transaction\\nprocessing, but the SLA contract can also serve to enforce the latter. For example, in\\nthe legacy-compatible version of FSS in which transactions are fetched from the mem-\\npool (see Section 5.2), transactions are eventually mined and placed on chain. A user\\ncan prove DON malfeasance by furnishing the SLA contract with a transaction that\\nwas mined but wasn’t transmitted by the DON for processing by the target contract\\nwithin the appropriate interval of time.15\\nIt is also possible to prove the existence of and penalize more fine-grained SLA\\nfailures, including errors in computation using executables (via, e.g., the mechanisms\\nfor proving correct off-chain state transactions outlined in Section 6.3) or failure to run\\nexecutables based on initiators visible on a DON, failure to relay data on the DON to\\nMAINCHAIN in a timely way, and so forth.\\nEconomics and Cryptoeconomics\\nFor the Chainlink network to achieve strong security within a decentralized trust model,\\nit is essential that nodes collectively exhibit correct behavior, meaning that they adhere\\na majority of the time exactly to DON protocols. In this section, we discuss approaches\\nto helping enforce such behavior by means of economic incentives, a.k.a. cryptoeconomic\\nincentives.\\nThese incentives fall into two categories: explicit and implicit, realized\\nrespectively through staking and future fee opportunity (FFO).\\nStaking:\\nStaking in Chainlink, as in other blockchain systems, involves network par-\\nticipants, i.e., oracle nodes, depositing locked funds in the form of LINK tokens. These\\nfunds, which we also refer to as stake or explicit stake are an explicit incentive. They\\nare subject to forfeiture upon node failure or malfeasance. In the blockchain context,\\nthis procedure is often called slashing.\\nStaking by oracle nodes in Chainlink, however, differs fundamentally from staking\\nby validators in permissionless blockchains. Validators can misbehave by equivocat-\\ning or adversarially ordering transactions.\\nThe underlying consensus protocol in a\\n15As users can replace transactions in the mempool, care is required to ensure a correct correspon-\\ndence between the mined and DON-submitted transactions.\\npermissionless blockchain, though, uses hard-and-fast block-validation rules and cryp-\\ntographic primitives to prevent validators from generating invalid blocks. In contrast,\\nprogrammatic protections cannot prevent a cheating oracle network from generating\\ninvalid reports. The reason is a key difference between the two types of system: transac-\\ntion validation in blockchains is a property of internal consistency, while the correctness\\nof oracle reports on a blockchain is a property of external, i.e., off-chain data.\\nWe have designed a preliminary staking mechanism for the Chainlink network based\\non an interactive protocol among oracle nodes that may make use of external data. This\\nmechanism creates financial incentives for correct behavior using explicit rewards and\\npenalties (slashing). As the mechanism is economic, it is designed to prevent node\\ncorruption by an adversary that uses financial resources to corrupt nodes by means of\\nbribery. (Such an adversary is very general, and extends, e.g., to nodes cooperating to\\nextract value from their collective misbehavior.)\\nThe Chainlink staking mechanism we have designed has some powerful and novel\\nfeatures.16 The main such feature is super-linear staking impact (specifically, quadratic).\\nAn adversary must have resources considerably in excess of nodes’ deposited funds in\\norder to subvert the mechanism. Our staking mechanism additionally provides protec-\\ntion against a stronger adversary than previously considered in similar systems, namely\\nan adversary that can create bribes conditioning on nodes’ future behavior. Addition-\\nally, we discuss how Chainlink tools such as DECO can help strengthen our staking\\nmechanism by facilitating correct adjudication in the case of faulty node behavior.\\nFuture fee opportunity (FFO):\\nPermissionless blockchains-of both the PoW\\nand PoS variety-today rely critically on what we call implicit incentives. These are\\neconomic incentives for honest behavior that derive not from explicit rewards, but\\nfrom platform participation itself. For example, the Bitcoin miner community is in-\\ncentivized against mounting a 51% attack by the risk of undermining confidence in\\nBitcoin, depressing its value, and consequently eroding the value of their collective\\ncapital investments in mining infrastructure [150].\\nThe Chainlink network benefits from a similar implicit incentive that we refer to\\nas future fee opportunity (FFO). Oracle nodes with strong performance histories or\\nreputations attract fees from users. Misbehavior by an oracle node jeopardizes future\\nfee payments and thus penalizes the node with an opportunity cost in terms of potential\\nrevenue earned through participation in the network. By analogy with explicit stake,\\nFFO may be viewed as a form of implicit stake, an incentive for honest behavior that\\nderives from the shared benefit of maintaining confidence in the platform on which\\nnode operators’ business depends, i.e., the positive performance and reputation of the\\nnetwork. This incentive is inherent in but not explicitly expressed in Chainlink network\\nprotocols. In Bitcoin, maintaining the value of mining operations as mentioned above\\n16The staking mechanism we describe here currently aims only to enforce delivery of correct reports\\nby oracle networks. We expect in future work to extend it to ensure correct execution of the many\\nother functionalities DONs will provide.\\nmay similarly be viewed as a form of implicit stake.\\nWe emphasize that FFO already exists in Chainlink and helps secure the network\\ntoday. Our main contribution in the further development of Chainlink will be a princi-\\npled, empirically driven approach to evaluating implicit incentives such as FFO through\\nwhat we call the Implicit-Incentive Framework (IIF). To estimate quantities such as the\\nfuture fee opportunity of nodes, the IIF will draw continuously on the comprehensive\\nperformance and payment data amassed by the Chainlink network. Such estimates\\nwill enable IIF-based parameterization of staking systems that reflects node incentives\\nwith greater accuracy than current heuristic and/or static models.\\nTo summarize, then, the two main economic incentives for correct oracle node\\nbehavior in the developing Chainlink network will be:\\n• Staking (deposited stake)\\no\\nExplicit incentive\\n• Future fee opportunity (FFO)\\no\\nImplicit incentive\\nThese two forms of incentive are complementary. Oracle nodes can simultaneously\\nparticipate in the Chainlink staking protocol, enjoy an ongoing revenue stream from\\nusers, and collectively benefit from their continued good behavior. Thus both incentives\\ncontribute to the cryptoeconomic security provided by an oracle network. Additionally,\\nthe two incentives can reinforce and/or be traded offagainst one another. For example,\\na new oracle operator without a performance history and revenue stream can stake a\\nlarge quantity of LINK as a guarantee of honest behavior, thereby attracting users\\nand fees. Conversely, an established oracle operator with a long, relatively fault-free\\nperformance history can charge substantial fees from a large user base and thus rely\\nmore heavily on its FFO as a form of implicit incentive.\\nIn general, the approach we consider here aims for a given amount of oracle-network\\nresource to create the greatest possible economic incentives in Chainlink for rational\\nagents-i.e., nodes maximizing their financial utility-to behave honestly. Put another\\nway, the goal is to maximize the financial resources required for an adversary to attack\\nthe network successfully. By formulating a staking protocol with mathematically well\\ndefined economic security and also using the IIF, we aim to measure the strength of\\nChainlink’s incentives as accurately as possible. The creators of relying contracts will\\nthen be able to determine with strong confidence whether an oracle network meets\\ntheir required levels of cryptoeconomic security.\\nThe virtuous cycle of economic security:\\nThe incentives we discuss in this sec-\\ntion, staking and FFO, have an impact beyond their reinforcement of the security of\\nDONs. They promise to induce what we call a virtuous cycle of economic security.\\nSuper-linear staking impact (and other economies of scale) result in lower operational\\ncost as a DON’s security grows. Lower cost attracts additional users to the DON,\\nboosting fee payments. A rise in fee payments continues to incentivize growth of the\\nnetwork, which perpetuates the virtuous cycle.\\nWe believe that the virtuous cycle of economic security is just one example of an\\neconomy of scale and network effect among others that we discuss later in this section.\\nSection organization: Staking presents notable technical and conceptual challenges for\\nwhich we have designed a mechanism with novel features. Staking will therefore be\\nour main focus in this section.\\nWe give an overview of the staking approach we introduce in this paper in Sec-\\ntion 9.1, followed by detailed discussion in Sections 9.2 to 9.5. We present the IFF\\nin Section 9.6. We present a summary view of Chainlink network incentives in Sec-\\ntion 9.7.\\nIn Section 9.8, we discuss the virtuous cycle of economic security our proposed stak-\\ning approach can bring to oracle networks. Finally, we briefly describe other potential\\neffects propelling growth of the Chainlink network in Section 9.9.\\n9.1\\nStaking Overview\\nThe staking mechanism design we introduce here, as noted above, involves an inter-\\nactive protocol among oracle nodes allowing for resolution of inconsistencies in the\\nreporting of external data. Staking aims to ensure honest behavior from rational or-\\nacle nodes. We can therefore model an adversary attacking a staking protocol as a\\nbriber: The adversary’s strategy is to corrupt oracle nodes using financial incentives.\\nThe adversary may derive financial resources prospectively from successfully tampering\\nwith an oracle report, e.g., offer to share the resulting profit with corrupted nodes.\\nWe aim in our staking mechanism design simultaneously at two ambitious goals:\\n1. Resisting a powerful adversary: The staking mechanism is designed to protect\\noracle networks against a broad class of adversaries that are capable of complex,\\nconditional bribing strategies, including prospective bribery, which offers bribes\\nto oracles whose identities are determined after the fact (e.g., offers bribes to\\noracles randomly selected for high-priority alerting). While other oracle designs\\nhave considered a narrow set of attacks without the full capabilities of a realistic\\nadversary, to the best of our knowledge the adversarial mechanism we introduce\\nhere is the first to explicitly address a broad set of bribing strategies and show\\nresistance in this model. Our model assumes that nodes besides the attacker are\\neconomically rational (as opposed to honest), and we assume the existence of a\\nsource of truth that is prohibitively expensive for typical usage but is available\\nin case of disagreement (discussed further below).\\n2. Achieving super-linear staking impact:\\nOur aim is to ensure that an oracle network composed of rational agents reports\\ntruthfully even in the presence of an attacker with a budget that is super-linear\\nin the total stake deposited by the entire network. In existing staking systems, if\\neach of n nodes stakes $d, an attacker can issue a credible bribe which requests\\nthat nodes behave dishonestly in exchange for a payment of slightly more than\\n$d to each node, using a total budget of about $dn. This is already a high bar as\\nthe attacker has to have a liquid budget on the order of the combined deposits of\\nall stakers in the network. Our goal is a still stronger degree of economic security\\nthan this already substantial hurdle. We aim to design the first staking system\\nthat can achieve security for a general attacker with a budget super-linear in n.\\nWhile practical considerations may achieve a lower impact, as we discuss below,\\nour preliminary design achieves an adversarial budget requirement greater than\\n$dn2/2, i.e., scaling quadratic in n, rendering bribery largely impractical even\\nwhen nodes stake only moderate amounts.\\nReaching these two goals requires an innovative combination of incentive design\\nand cryptography.\\nKey ideas:\\nOur staking approach hinges on an idea we call watchdog priority.\\nA report generated by a Chainlink oracle network and sent to a relying contract\\n(e.g., on an asset price) is aggregated from individual reports contributed by partici-\\npating nodes (e.g., by taking the median). Typically a service-level agreement (SLA)\\nspecifies acceptable bounds of deviation for reports, i.e., how far a node’s report can\\ndeviate from the aggregate report and how far the aggregate should be permitted to\\ndeviate from the true value to be considered correct.\\nIn our staking system, for a given reporting round, each oracle node can act as\\na watchdog to raise an alert if it believes the aggregate report is incorrect. In each\\nreporting round, each oracle node is assigned a public priority that determines the\\norder in which its alert (if any) will be processed. Our mechanism aims at reward\\nconcentration, meaning that the highest-priority watchdog to raise an alert earns the\\nentire reward yielded by confiscating the deposits of faulty nodes.\\nOur staking system designs involve two tiers: the first, default tier, and the second,\\nbackstop tier. The first tier is the oracle network itself, a set of n nodes. (For simplicity,\\nwe assume n is odd.) If a majority of nodes report incorrect values, a watchdog in the\\nfirst tier is strongly incentivized to raise an alert. If an alert is raised, the reporting\\ndecision of the network is then escalated to a second tier-a high-cost, maximum-\\nreliability system that can be user-specified in the network service-level agreement.\\nThis could be a system which, for example, is composed only of nodes with strong\\nhistorical reliability scores, or one that has an order of magnitude more oracles than\\nthe first tier. Additionally, as discussed in Section 9.4.3, DECO or Town Crier can serve\\nas powerful tools to help ensure efficient and conclusive adjudication in the second tier.\\nFor simplicity we thus assume that this second-tier system arrives at a correct report\\nvalue.\\nWhile it might seem attractive just to rely on the second tier to generate all reports,\\nthe benefit of our design is that it consistently achieves the security properties of the\\nsecond-tier system while only paying the operating cost, in the typical case, of the\\nfirst-tier system.\\nWatchdog priority results in super-linear staking impact in the following way: if the\\nfirst-tier oracle network outputs an incorrect result and a number of watchdog nodes\\nalert, the staking incentive mechanism rewards the highest-priority watchdog with\\nmore than $dn/2 drawn from the deposits of the (majority) misbehaving nodes. The\\ntotal reward is thus concentrated in the hands of this single watchdog, which therefore\\ndetermines the minimum that an adversary must promise a potential watchdog to\\nincentivize it not to alert. Since our mechanism ensures that every oracle gets the\\nchance to act as watchdog if the higher-priority watchdogs have accepted their bribes\\n(and chosen not to alert), the adversary must therefore offer a bribe of more than\\n$dn/2 to every node to prevent any alert being raised. Since there are n nodes, the\\nadversary’s requisite budget for a successful bribe amounts to more than $dn2/2, which\\nis quadratic in the number n of nodes in the network.\\n9.2\\nBackground\\nOur approach to staking draws on research in the fields of game theory and mechanism\\ndesign (MD) (for a textbook reference, see [177]). Game theory is the mathematically\\nformalized study of strategic interaction. In this context, a game is a model of such\\nan interaction, typically in the real world, that codifies sets of actions available to\\nparticipants in the game, known as players. A game also specifies the payoffs obtained\\nby the individual players-rewards that depend on a player’s chosen actions and the\\nactions of the other players. Perhaps the best known example of a game studied in game\\ntheory is the Prisoners’ Dilemma [178]. Game theorists generally aim to understand\\nthe equilibrium or equilibria (if any) represented in a given game. An equilibrium is\\na set of strategies (one for each player) such that no one player can obtain a higher\\npayoffby unilaterally deviating from its strategy.\\nMechanism design, meanwhile, is the science of designing incentives such that the\\nequilibrium of an interaction (and its associated game) has some desirable property.\\nMD may be viewed as the inverse of game theory: The canonical question in game\\ntheory is, “given the incentives and model, what will the equilibrium be?” In MD, the\\nquestion is instead, “what incentives will result in a game with a desirable equilibrium?”\\nA typical goal of a mechanism designer is to create an ‘incentive compatible’ mecha-\\nnism, meaning that participants in the mechanism (e.g., an auction or other information\\nelicitation system [228]) are incentivized to report the truth on some matter (e.g., how\\nmuch they value a particular item). The Vickrey (second-price) auction is perhaps the\\nbest known incentive compatible mechanism, in which participants submit sealed bids\\nfor an item and the highest bidder wins the item but pays the second-highest price\\n[214]. Cryptoeconomics is a domain-specific form of MD that leverages cryptographic\\ntechniques to create desirable equilibria within decentralized systems.\\nBribery and collusion create significant challenges throughout the field of MD. Al-\\nmost all mechanisms break in the presence of collusion, defined as side contracts be-\\ntween the parties participating in a mechanism [125, 130]. Bribery, in which an exter-\\nnal party introduces novel incentives into the game, presents an even tougher problem\\nthan does collusion; collusion may be viewed as a special case of bribery among game\\nparticipants.\\nBlockchain systems can often be conceptualized as games with monetary (cryptocurrency-\\nbased) payoffs. A simple example is Proof-of-Work mining: miners have an action space\\nin which they can choose the hashrate with which to mine for blocks. The payoffof min-\\ning is a guaranteed negative reward (cost of electricity and equipment) plus a stochastic\\npositive reward (mining subsidy) that depends on the number of other active miners\\n[106, 172] and transaction fees. Crowdsourced oracles like SchellingCoin [68] are an-\\nother example: the action space is the set of possible reports an oracle may send, while\\nthe payoffis the reward specified by the oracle mechanism, e.g., payment might depend\\non how close an oracle’s report is to the median of the other reports [26, 68, 119, 185].\\nBlockchain games offer ripe opportunities for collusion and bribery attacks; indeed,\\nsmart contracts can even facilitate such attacks [96, 165]. Perhaps the best known\\nbribery attack on crowdsourced oracles is the p-plus-epsilon attack [67]. This attack\\narises in the context of a SchellingCoin-like mechanism in which players submit boolean-\\nvalued reports (i.e., false or true) and are rewarded with p if they agree with the\\nmajority submission.\\nIn a p-plus-epsilon attack, the attacker credibly promises to,\\ne.g., pay users $p + ϵ for voting false if and only if the majority submission is true.\\nThe result is an equilibrium, in which all players are incentivized to report false\\nirrespective of what other players do; consequently, the briber can induce the nodes\\nthrough its promised bribe to report false without actually paying the bribe (!).\\nExploration of other briber strategies in the context of oracles, however-and par-\\nticularly oracles that are not crowdsourced-has been limited to fairly weak adversarial\\nmodels. For example, in the PoW setting, researchers have studied outcome-contingent\\nbribes, i.e., bribes paid only if a target message is successfully censored and does not\\nappear in a block, irrespective of an individual miner’s action [96, 165]. In the case\\nof oracles, however, other than the p-plus-epsilon attack, we are aware only of work in\\na strictly limited model of bribery in which a briber sends a bribe conditioned on an\\nindividual player’s action, not on the resulting outcome.\\nHere we sketch designs of information-elicitation mechanisms that remain incentive\\ncompatible even in a strong adversarial model, as described in the next subsection.\\n9.3\\nModeling Assumptions\\nIn this subsection, we explain how we model the behavior and capabilities of players in\\nour system, specifically first-tier oracle nodes, nodes in the second-tier (adjudication)\\nlayer, and adversaries.\\n9.3.1\\nFirst-Tier Incentive Model: Rational Actors\\nMany blockchain systems rely for security on the assumption of some number of honest\\nparticipating nodes. Nodes are defined to be honest if they follow the protocol even\\nwhen it is not in their financial interest to do so. Proof-of-Work systems typically\\nrequire the majority of hash power to be honest, Proof-of-Stake systems typically re-\\nquire 2/3 or more of all participating stake to be honest, and even layer-2 systems like\\nArbitrum [141] require at least a single honest participant.\\nIn modeling for our staking mechanism, we make a much weaker assumption. (To be\\nclear, weaker assumptions mean stronger security properties and are therefore prefer-\\nable.) We assume that the adversary has corrupted, i.e., controls, some (minority)\\nfraction of first-tier oracle nodes. We model the remaining nodes not as honest agents,\\nbut as rational expected-utility maximizers. These nodes act entirely according to self-\\ninterested financial incentives, choosing actions that result in an expected financial\\ngain. For example, if a node is offered a bribe larger than the reward resulting from\\nhonest behavior, it will accept the bribe.\\nNote on adversarial nodes:\\nIn accordance with the trust modeling common for\\ndecentralized systems, we assume that all nodes are rational, i.e., seeking to maximize\\nnet revenue, rather than controlled by a malicious adversary. Our claims, however-\\nspecifically super-linear or quadratic staking impact-hold asymptotically provided\\nthat the set of adversarially controlled nodes is at most (1/2 −c)n, for some positive\\nconstant c.\\n9.3.2\\nSecond-Tier Adjudication Model: Correctness by Assumption\\nRecall that a critical feature of our staking mechanism that helps achieve security\\nagainst rational nodes is its second-tier system.\\nIn our proposed staking mechanism, any oracle may raise an alert indicating that\\nit believes the output of the mechanism is incorrect. An alert results in a high-trust\\nsecond-tier system activating and reporting the correct result. Thus, a key modeling\\nrequirement for our approach is correct adjudication, i.e., correct reporting by the\\nsecond-tier system.\\nOur staking model assumes a second-tier system that acts as an incorruptible, maxi-\\nmally reliable source of truth. Such a system is likely to be expensive and slow, and thus\\ninappropriate for use for the typical case. In the equilibrium case, however, i.e., when\\nthe first-tier system functions correctly, the second-tier system will not be invoked.\\nInstead, its existence boosts the security of the whole oracle system by providing a\\nhigh-assurance backstop.\\nThe use of a high-trust, high-cost adjudication layer resembles the appeals process\\nat the heart of most judicial systems. It is also already common in the design of oracle\\nsystems, e.g., [119, 185]. We briefly discuss approaches to realization of the second tier\\nin our mechanism in Section 9.4.3.\\nOur staking protocol uses the assumed correct adjudication of the second-tier sys-\\ntem as a credible threat to enforce correct reporting by oracle nodes. The protocol\\nconfiscates part or all of the stake of oracle nodes that generate reports identified by\\nthe second-tier system as incorrect. Oracle nodes are thus deterred from misbehaving\\nby the resulting financial penalty. This approach is similar in flavor to that used in\\noptimistic rollups, e.g., [141, 10].\\n9.3.3\\nAdversarial Model\\nOur staking mechanism is designed to elicit truthful information while achieving secu-\\nrity against a broad, well-defined class of adversaries. It improves upon prior works,\\nwhich either omit an explicit adversarial model or focus on narrow sub-classes of adver-\\nsaries, e.g., the p-plus-epsilon adversary discussed above. Our goal is to design a staking\\nmechanism with formally proven security against the full spectrum of adversaries likely\\nto be encountered in practice.\\nWe model our adversary as having a fixed (parameterizable) budget, denoted by\\n$B. The adversary can communicate individually and confidentially with each oracle in\\nthe network, and can secretly offer any individual oracle guaranteed payment of a bribe\\ncontingent on publicly observable outcomes of the mechanism. Outcomes determining\\nbribes can include, for example, the value reported by the oracle, any public messages\\nsent by any oracle to the mechanism (e.g., an alert), the values reported by other\\noracles, and the value output by the mechanism.\\nNo mechanism can secure against an attacker with unlimited capabilities. We there-\\nfore consider some behaviors as unrealistic or out-of-scope. We assume our attacker\\ncannot break standard cryptographic primitives, and, as noted above, has a fixed (if\\npotentially large) budget $B. We further assume that the adversary does not control\\ncommunication in the oracle network, specifically that it cannot substantially delay\\ntraffic between first-tier and/or second-tier nodes. (Whether the adversary can ob-\\nserve such communication depends on the particular mechanism, as we explain below.)\\nInformally, however, as noted above, we assume that the adversary can: (1) Corrupt\\na fraction of oracle nodes ((1/2 −c)-fraction for some constant c), i.e., fully control\\nthem, and (2) Offer bribes to any desired nodes, with guaranteed payment contingent\\non outcomes specified by the adversary, as described above.\\nWhile we don’t offer a formal model or complete taxonomy of the adversary’s full\\nrange of bribing capabilities in this whitepaper, here are examples of the kinds of\\nbribers encompassed by our model. For simplicity, we assume that oracles emit Boolean\\nreports whose correct value (w.l.o.g.) is true, and that a final outcome is computed as\\nan aggregate of these reports to be used by a consuming smart contract. The briber’s\\naim is for the final outcome to be incorrect, i.e., false.\\n• Unconditional briber: Briber offers bribe $b to any oracle that reports false.\\n• Probabilistic briber: Briber offers bribe $b with some probability q to any oracle\\nthat reports false.\\n• false-outcome conditioned briber: Briber offers bribe $b to any oracle that re-\\nports false provided that the final outcome is false.\\n• No-alert-conditioned briber: Briber offers bribe $b to any oracle that reports\\nfalse as long as no alert is raised.\\n• p-plus-epsilon Briber: Briber offers bribe $b to any oracle that reports false as\\nlong as the majority of oracles do not report false.\\n• Prospective briber: Briber offers bribe $b in advance to whichever oracle is selected\\nfor a randomized role and reports false. In our proposed staking protocol, all\\nnodes act as potential watchdogs, and we are able to show that randomization\\nof watchdog priorities does not lend itself to prospective bribery. Many proof-\\nof-work, proof-of-stake, and permissioned systems are susceptible to prospective\\nbribery, however, which shows the importance of considering it in our adversarial\\nmodel and ensuring that our staking protocols are resilient to it. See Appendix E\\nfor more details.\\n9.3.4\\nHow Much Cryptoeconomic Security Is Enough?\\nA rational adversary will only spend money to attack a system if it can obtain a profit\\nlarger than its expenditure.\\nThus for our adversarial model and proposed staking\\nmechanism, $B may be viewed as a measure of the potential profit an adversary is able\\nto extract from relying smart contracts by corrupting an oracle network and causing it\\nto generate an incorrect report or set of reports. In deciding whether an oracle network\\noffers a sufficient degree of cryptoeconomic security for their purposes, a user should\\nassess the network from this perspective.\\nFor plausible adversaries in practical settings, we expect that $B will generally be\\nsubstantially smaller than the total assets in relying smart contracts. In most cases, it\\nis infeasible for an adversary to extract these assets in their totality.\\n9.4\\nStaking Mechanism: Sketch\\nHere we present the main ideas and general structure of the staking mechanism we\\nare currently considering.\\nFor ease of presentation, we describe a simple but slow\\n(multi-round) protocol in this subsection. We note, however, that this scheme is quite\\npractical. Given the economic assurances provided by the mechanism, i.e., the penal-\\nization of and consequent incentive against faulty nodes, many users may be willing to\\naccept reports optimistically. In other words, such users may accept reports prior to\\npotential adjudication by the second tier.\\nUsers unwilling to accept reports optimistically can choose to wait until the protocol\\nexecution terminates, i.e., until any potential escalation to the second tier occurs. This,\\nhowever, can substantially slow the confirmation time for reports. We therefore briefly\\nFigure 15: Schematic of staking scheme with alerting.

This alert causes second-tier resolution, which we assume arrives at a correct\\nreport. Nodes with incorrect reports are punished, in the sense that their stakes are\\nslashed and awarded to watchdogs. This basic structure is common in oracle systems,\\nas in, e.g., [119, 185].\\nThe key innovation in our design, mentioned briefly above, is that every node is\\nassigned a distinct priority in the ordering of potential watchdogs. That is, watchdogs\\nare given opportunities to alert in priority sequence. Recall that if a node has the\\nhighest priority to raise an alert, it receives the slashed deposit $d of every misbehaving\\nnode, for a total of more than $dn/2 = $d × n/2, as an incorrect report implies a\\nmajority of bad nodes. Consequently, the adversary must pay at least this reward to\\nbribe an arbitrary node. Thus, to bribe a majority of nodes, the adversary must pay a\\nlarge bribe to a majority of nodes, namely, strictly more than $dn2/2.\\nWe show schematically how alerting and watchdog escalation works in Fig. 15.\\n9.4.1\\nFurther Mechanism Details\\nThe bribery-resistant system we now describe in further detail is a simplified sketch of\\nthe two-tiered construction we intend to build. Most of our focus will be on describing\\nthe first-tier network (henceforth simply “network” where clear from context) along\\nwith its incentive mechanism and the procedure for escalation to the second tier.\\nConsider a Chainlink network composed of n oracle nodes that are responsible for\\nregularly (e.g., once a minute) reporting a boolean value (e.g., whether the market\\ncapitalization of BTC exceeds that of ETH). As part of the staking mechanism, nodes\\nmust provide two deposits: a deposit $d subject to slashing in the event of disagreement\\nwith the majority and a watchdog deposit $dw subject to slashing in the event of a faulty\\nescalation. We assume that the nodes cannot copy the submissions of other nodes, e.g.,\\nthrough a commit-reveal scheme as discussed in Section 5.3. In each round, nodes first\\ncommit to their report, and once all nodes have committed (or a timeout has expired),\\nnodes reveal their reports.\\nFor each report to be generated, every node is also given a watchdog priority be-\\ntween 1 and n chosen at random, with 1 being top priority. This priority enables the\\nconcentration of reward in the hands of one watchdog. After all reports are public,\\nan alerting phase ensues. Over a sequence of n (synchronous) rounds, the node with\\npriority i has the opportunity to alert in round i.\\nLet us consider the possible outcomes for the mechanism after nodes have revealed\\ntheir reports. Again assuming a binary report, suppose the correct value is true and\\nthe incorrect one is false. Suppose also that the first-tier mechanism outputs the\\nmajority value output by nodes as the final report r.\\nThere are three possible outcomes in the mechanism:\\n• Complete agreement: In the best case, nodes are in complete agreement: all nodes\\nare available and have provided a timely report of the same value r (either true\\nor false). In this case, the network need only forward r to relying contracts\\nand reward each node with a fixed per-round payment $p, which is much smaller\\nthan $d.\\n• Partial agreement: It is possible that some nodes are offline or there is dis-\\nagreement about which value is correct, but most nodes report true and only a\\nminority reports false. This case is also straightforward. The majority value\\n(true) is computed, resulting in a correct report r. All nodes that reported r are\\nrewarded with $p while the oracles that reported incorrectly have their deposits\\nslashed modestly, e.g., by $10p.\\n• Alert: In the event that a watchdog believes the output of the network is incorrect,\\nit publicly triggers an alert, escalating the mechanism to the second-tier network.\\nThere are then two possible results:\\n- Correct alert: If the second-tier network confirms that the output of the\\nFigure 16: Amplifying briber’s cost through concentrated alerting rewards. A bribing\\nadversary must bribe each node with more than the reward it stands to gain by alerting\\n(shown as a red bar). If alerting rewards are shared, then this reward may be relatively\\nsmall. Concentrated alerting rewards increase the reward that any single node may\\nobtain (tall red bar). Consequently the total payout by the adversary for a viable bribe\\n(gray regions) is much larger with concentrated than shared alerting rewards.\\nfirst-tier network was incorrect, the alerting watchdog node receives a reward\\nconsisting of all slashed deposits, and thus more than $dn/2.\\n- Faulty alert: If the second-tier and first-tier oracles agree, the escalation is\\ndeemed faulty and the alerting node loses its $dw deposit.\\nIn the case of optimistic acceptance of reports, watchdog alerts do not cause\\nany change in execution of relying contracts. For contracts designed to await\\npotential arbitration by the second-tier committee, watchdog alerts delay but\\ndo not freeze contract execution. It is also possible for contracts to designate a\\nfailover DON for periods of adjudication.\\n9.4.2\\nQuadratic Staking Impact\\nThe ability for every node to act as a watchdog, combined with strict node priority\\nensuring concentrated rewards, enables the mechanism to achieve quadratic staking\\nimpact for each kind of bribing attacker described in Section 9.3.3. Recall that this\\nmeans specifically in our setting that, for a network with n nodes each with deposit\\n$d, a successful briber (of any of the kinds above) must have a budget of bigger than\\n$dn2/2.\\nTo be precise, the briber must corrupt at least (n+1)/2 nodes, since the briber must\\ncorrupt a majority of n nodes (for odd n, by assumption). Thus, a watchdog stands to\\nearn a reward of $d(n + 1)/2. The briber consequently must pay this amount to every\\nnode to ensure that none acts as a watchdog. We are working to show formally that if\\nthe briber has a budget of at most $d(n2 + n)/2, then the subgame perfect equilibrium\\nof the game between the bribers and the oracles-in other words, the equilibrium at\\nany point during the play of the game-is for the briber not to issue the bribe and for\\neach oracle to report its true values honestly.\\nWe have explained above how it is possible that a successful briber could require a\\nbudget significantly larger than that of the sum of the node deposits. To illustrate this\\nintuitive result, Fig. 16 shows the impact of concentrated alert rewards graphically.\\nAs we see there, if the reward for watchdog alerting-namely the deposits of bribed\\nnodes reporting false)-were split among all potential alerting, the total amount that\\nany individual alerting node could expect would be relatively small, on the order of\\n$d.\\nA briber, knowing that a payout of larger than $d was improbable, could use\\na false-outcome conditional bribe to bribe each of n nodes with slightly more than\\n$d + ϵ.\\nCounterintuitively, Fig. 16 shows that a system that distributes a reward broadly\\namong nodes signaling an alert is far weaker than one that concentrates the reward in\\nthe hands of a single watchdog.\\nExample parameters:\\nConsider a (first-tier) network with n = 100 nodes, each\\ndepositing $d = $20K. This network would have a total of $2M deposited but would\\nbe protected against a briber with budget $100M = $dn2/2. Increasing the number of\\noracles is more effective than increasing $d, of course, and can have a dramatic effect:\\na network with n = 300 nodes and deposits $d = $20K would be protected against a\\nbriber with budget up to $900M.\\nNote that a staking system can in many cases protect smart contracts representing\\nmore value than the offered level of bribery protection. This is because an adversary\\nattacking these contracts cannot extract the full value in many cases. For example, a\\nChainlink-powered contract securing $1B in value may only require security against a\\nbriber with $100M in resource because such an adversary can feasibly extract a profit\\nof only 10% of the value of the contract.\\nNote:\\nThe idea that the value of a network can grow quadratically is expressed in\\nthe well known Metcalfe’s Law [167, 235], which states that the value of a network\\ngrows quadratically in the number of connected entities. Metcalfe’s Law, however,\\narises from growth in the number of potential pairwise network connections, a dif-\\nferent phenomenon than that underlying quadratic staking impact in our incentive\\nmechanism.\\n9.4.3\\nRealization of Second Tier\\nTwo operational features facilitate realization of a high-reliability second tier: (1)\\nSecond-tier adjudication should be a rare event in oracle networks and therefore can\\nbe significantly more costly than normal operation of the first tier and (2) Assuming\\noptimistically accepted reports-or contracts whose execution can await arbitration-\\nthe second tier need not execute in real time.\\nThese features result in a range of\\nconfiguration options for the second tier to meet the requirements of particular DONs.\\nAs an example approach, a second tier committee can consist of nodes selected by a\\nDON (i.e., first tier) from the longest-serving and most reliable nodes in the Chainlink\\nnetwork. In addition to considerable relevant operational experience, the operators\\nof such nodes have a considerable implicit incentive in FFO that motivates a desire\\nto ensure that the Chainlink network remains highly reliable. They also have publicly\\navailable performance histories that provide transparency into their reliability. Second-\\ntier nodes, it is worth noting, need not be participants in the first-tier network, and\\nmay adjudicate faults across multiple first-tier networks.\\nNodes in a given DON can pre-designate and publicly commit to a set of n′ such\\nnodes as constituting the second-tier committee for that DON. Additionally, DON\\nnodes publish a parameter k′ ≤n′ that determines the number of second-tier votes\\nrequired to penalize a first-tier node. When an alert is generated for a given report,\\nthe members of the second tier vote on the correctness of the values provided by each\\nof the first-tier nodes. Any first-tier node that receives k′ negative votes forfeits its\\ndeposits to the watchdog node.\\nBecause of the rareness of adjudication and opportunity for extended-time execution\\nnoted above, in contrast to the first tier, nodes in the second tier can:\\n1. Be highly compensated for conducting adjudication.\\n2. Draw on additional data sources, beyond even the diverse set used by the first-\\ntier.\\n3. Rely on manual and/or expert inspection and intervention, e.g., to identify and\\nreconcile errors in source data and distinguish between an honest node relaying\\nfaulty data and a misbehaving node.\\nWe emphasize that the approach we have just described for selection of second-\\ntier nodes and policy governing adjudication represents just a point within a large\\ndesign space of possible realizations of the second tier. Our incentive mechanism offers\\ncomplete flexibility as to how the second tier is realized. Individual DONs can thus\\nconstitute and set rules for their second tiers that meet the particular requirements\\nand expectations of participating nodes and users.\\nDECO and Town Crier as adjudication tools:\\nIt is essential for the second tier\\nin our mechanism to be able to distinguish between adversarial first-tier nodes that\\nintentionally produce incorrect reports and honest first-tier nodes that unintentionally\\nrelay data that is incorrect at the source. Only then can the second tier implement\\nslashing to disincentivize cheating, the goal of our mechanism. DECO and Town Crier\\nare powerful tools that can enable second-tier nodes to make this critical distinction\\nreliably.\\nSecond-tier nodes may in some cases be able to directly query the data source used\\nby a first-tier node or use ADO Section 7.1 in order to check whether an incorrect report\\nresulted from a faulty data source. In other cases, however, second tier nodes may lack\\ndirect access to a first-tier node’s data source. In such cases, correct adjudication would\\nappear to be infeasible or require a reliance on subjective judgment. Previous oracle\\ndispute systems have relied upon inefficient, escalating rounds of voting to address such\\nchallenges.\\nUsing DECO or Town Crier, however, a first tier node can prove correct behavior\\nto second-tier nodes. (See Section 3.6.2 for details on the two systems.) Specifically, if\\nthe second tier node identifies a first-tier node as having output a faulty report value ˜r,\\nthe first-tier node can use DECO or Town Crier to generate tamperproof evidence for\\nsecond-tier nodes that it is correctly relaying ˜r correctly from a (TLS-enabled) source\\nrecognized as authoritative by the DON. Critically, the first-tier node can do this\\nwithout second-tier nodes requiring direct access to the data source.17 Consequently,\\ncorrect adjudication is feasible in Chainlink for any desired data source.\\n9.4.4\\nMisreporting Insurance\\nThe strong bribery resistance achieved by our staking mechanism relies fundamentally\\non slashed funds being awarded to alerters. Without a monetary reward, alerters would\\nhave no direct incentive to reject bribes. As a result, however, slashed funds are not\\navailable to compensate users harmed by incorrect reports, e.g., users that lose money\\nwhen incorrect price data is relayed to a smart contract.\\nBy assumption, incorrect reports don’t pose a problem if reports are accepted by a\\ncontract only after potential adjudication, i.e., action by the second tier. As explained\\nabove, though, to achieve the best possible performance, contracts may instead rely\\noptimistically on the mechanism to enforce correct reporting, meaning that they accept\\nreports before potential second-tier adjudication.\\nIndeed, such optimistic behavior\\nis safe in our model assuming rational adversaries whose budgets do not exceed the\\nstaking impact of the mechanism.\\nUsers concerned about the improbable event of a mechanism failure resulting from,\\ne.g., adversaries with overwhelming financial resources, may wish to employ an addi-\\ntional layer of economic security in the form of misreporting insurance. We know of\\nmultiple insurers already intending to offer smart-contract-backed policies of this kind\\nfor Chainlink-secured protocols in the near future, including through innovative mech-\\nanisms such as DAOs, e.g., [7]. The existence of performance history for Chainlink\\nnodes and other data about nodes such as their stake amounts provides an exception-\\nally strong basis for actuarial assessments of risk, making it possible to price policies\\nin ways that are inexpensive for policyholders yet sustainable for insurers.\\n17With Town Crier, it is additionally possible for first-tier nodes to locally generate attestations\\nof correctness for the reports they output and provide these attestations to second-tier nodes on an\\nas-needed basis.\\nBasic forms of misreporting insurance can be implemented in a trustworthy and\\nefficient manner using smart contracts. As a simple example, a parametric insurance\\ncontract SCins can compensate policyholders automatically if our incentive mechanism’s\\nsecond tier identifies an error in a report generated in the first tier.\\nA user U that wishes to purchase an insurance policy, e.g., the creator of a target\\ncontract SC, can submit a request to a decentralized insurer for an policy amount\\n$M on the contract. On approving U, the insurer can set an ongoing (e.g., monthly)\\npremium of $P in SCins. While U pays the premium, her policy remains active.\\nIf a reporting failure occurs in SC, the result will be the emission of a pair (r1, r2)\\nof conflicting reports for SC, where r1 is signed by the first tier in our mechanism and\\nr2, the corresponding corrected report, is signed by the second tier. If the U furnishes\\nsuch a valid pair (r1, r2) to SCins, the contract automatically pays her $M, provided\\nher premium payments are up-to-date.\\n9.5\\nSingle-Round Variant\\nThe protocol described in the previous subsection requires that the second-tier com-\\nmittee wait n rounds to determine whether a watchdog has raised an alert.\\nThis\\nrequirement holds even in the optimistic case, i.e., when the first tier is functioning\\ncorrectly. For users unwilling to accept reports optimistically, i.e., prior to potential\\nadjudication, the delay associated with that approach would be unworkable.\\nFor this reason, we are also exploring alternative protocols that require just one\\nround. In this approach, all oracle nodes submit secret bits indicating whether or not\\nthey wish to raise an alert. The second-tier committee then checks these values in\\npriority order. To provide a rough sketch, such a scheme might involve the following\\nsteps:\\n1. Watchdog bit submission: Each node Oi secret-shares a one-bit watchdog value\\nwi ∈{no alert, alert} among nodes in the second tier for every report it gen-\\nerates.\\n2. Anonymous tips: Any oracle node can submit an anonymous tip α to the second-\\ntier committee in the same round that watchdog bits are submitted. This tip α\\nis a message indicating that an alert has been raised for the current report.\\n3. Watchdog bit checking: The second-tier committee reveals oracle nodes’ watchdog\\nbits in priority order.\\nNote that nodes must send no alert watchdog bits when they don’t alert: oth-\\nerwise, traffic analysis reveals all nodes’ bits. The protocol does reveal the no alert\\nwatchdog bits of nodes with higher priority than the highest-priority alerting watchdog.\\nObserve that what is revealed is identical with that of our n-round protocol. Re-\\nwards are also distributed identically with that scheme, i.e., the first identified watchdog\\nreceives the slashed deposits of nodes that have submitted incorrect reports.\\nThe use of anonymous tips enables the second-tier committee to remain non-\\ninteractive in cases where no alert has been raised, reducing communication complexity\\nin the common case. Note that any watchdog that raises an alert has an economic in-\\ncentive to submit an anonymous tip: If no tip is submitted, no reward is paid to any\\nnode.\\nTo ensure that the sender Oi of an anonymous tip α cannot be identified by the\\nadversary based on network data, the anonymous tip can be sent over an anonymous\\nchannel, e.g, via Tor, or, more practically, proxied via a cloud service provider. To\\nauthenticate the tip as originating with O, Oi can sign α using a ring signature [39, 192].\\nAlternatively, to prevent unattributable denial-of-service attacks against the second-\\ntier committee by a malicious oracle node, α can be an anonymous credential with\\nrevocable anonymity [73].\\nThis protocol, while practically achievable, has somewhat heavyweight engineering\\nrequirements (which we are exploring ways to reduce). First-tier nodes, for instance,\\nmust communicate directly with second-tier nodes, requiring maintenance of a direc-\\ntory. The need for anonymous channels and ring signatures adds to the engineering\\ncomplexity of the scheme. Finally, there is a special trust requirement briefly discussed\\nin the note below. We are therefore also exploring simpler schemes that still achieve\\nsuper-linear staking impact, but perhaps less than quadratic, in which a briber asymp-\\ntotically needs resources of at least $n log n, for example. Some of the schemes under\\nconsideration involve random selection of a strict subset of nodes to act as watchdogs,\\nin which case prospective bribery becomes an especially powerful attack.\\nRemark:\\nThe security of this single-round staking mechanism requires untappable\\nchannels between oracle and second-tier nodes-a standard requirement in coercion-\\nresistant systems, e.g., voting [82, 138], and a reasonable one in practice.\\nAdditionally, however, a node Oi that seeks to cooperate with a briber can construct\\nits secret shares in such a way as to show the briber that it has encoded a particular\\nvalue. For example, if Oi does not know which nodes the briber controls, then Oi can\\nsubmit 0-valued shares to all committee members. The briber can then verify Oi’s\\ncompliance probabilistically. To avoid this problem in any single-round protocol, we\\nrequire that Oi know the identity of at least one honest second-tier node.\\nWith an interactive protocol in which each second-tier node adds a randomization\\nfactor to shares, the best the briber can do is enforce selection by Oi of a random\\nwatchdog bit.\\n9.6\\nImplicit-Incentive Framework (IIF)\\nFFO is a form of implicit incentive for correct behavior in the Chainlink network. It\\nfunctions like explicit stake, i.e., deposits, in that it helps enforce economic security for\\nthe network. In other words, FFO should be included as part of the (effective) deposit\\n$d of a node in the network.\\nThe question is: How do we measure FFO and other forms of implicit incentive\\nwithin the Chainlink network?\\nThe Implicit-Incentive Framework (IIF) is a set of\\nprinciples and techniques that we plan to develop for this purpose. Blockchain systems\\nprovide many forms of unprecedented transparency, and the high-trust records of node\\nperformance they create are a springboard for our vision of how the IIF will work.\\nHere we very briefly sketch ideas on key elements of the IIF.\\nThe IIF itself will consist of a set of factors we identify as important in evaluating\\nimplicit incentives, along with mechanisms for publishing relevant data in a high-\\nassurance form for consumption by analytics algorithms. Different Chainlink users may\\nwish to use the IIF in different ways, e.g., giving different weighting to different factors.\\nWe expect analytics services to arise in the community that help users apply the IIF\\naccording to their individual risk-evaluation preferences, and our goal is to facilitate\\nsuch services by ensuring their access to high-assurance and timely supporting data,\\nas we discuss below (Section 9.6.4).\\n9.6.1\\nFuture Fee Opportunity\\nNodes participate in the Chainlink ecosystem to earn a share of the fees that the net-\\nworks pay out for any of the various services we have described in this paper, from\\nordinary data feeds to advanced services such as decentralized identity, fair sequencing,\\nand confidentiality-preserving DeFi. Fees in the Chainlink network support node oper-\\nators’ costs for, e.g., running servers, acquiring necessary data licenses, and maintaining\\na global staffto ensure high uptime. FFO denotes the service fees, net of expenses,\\nthat a node stands to gain in the future-or lose should it demonstrate faulty behavior.\\nFFO is a form of stake that helps secure the network.\\nA helpful feature of FFO is the fact that on-chain data (supplemented by off-chain\\ndata) establish a high-trust record of a node’s history, enabling computation of FFO\\nin a transparent, empirically driven manner.\\nA simple, first-order measure of FFO can derive from the average net revenue of a\\nnode over a period of time (i.e., gross revenue minus operating expenses). FFO may\\nthen be calculated as, e.g., the net present value [114] of cumulative future net revenue,\\nin other words, the time-discounted value of all future earnings.\\nNode revenue can be volatile, however, as shown for example in Fig. 17.\\nMore importantly, node revenue may not follow a distribution that is stationary\\nover time. Consequently, other factors we plan to explore in estimating FFO include:\\n• Performance history: An operator’s performance history-including the correct-\\nness and timeliness of its reports, as well as its up time-provides an objective\\ntouchstone for users to evaluate its reliability.\\nPerformance history will thus\\nprovide a critical factor in users’ selection of oracle nodes (or, with the advent\\nof DONs, their selection of DONs). A strong performance history is likely to\\ncorrelate with high ongoing revenue.18\\n18An important research question we intend to address is detection of falsified service volumes.\\nFigure 17: Revenue earned by Chainlink nodes on a single data feed (ETH-USD) during\\na representative week in March 2021.\\n• Data access: While oracles may obtain many forms of data from open APIs,\\ncertain forms of data or certain high-quality sources may be available only on a\\nsubscription basis or through contractual agreements. Privileged access to certain\\ndata sources can play a role in creating a stable revenue stream.\\n• DON participation: With the advent of DONs, communities of nodes will come\\ntogether to provide particular services. We expect that many DONs will include\\noperators on a selective basis, establishing participation in reputable DONs as a\\nprivileged market position that helps ensure a consistent source of revenue.\\n• Cross-platform activity: Some node operators may have well-established pres-\\nences and performance track records in other contexts, e.g., as PoS validators or\\ndata providers in non-blockchain contexts. Their performance in these other sys-\\ntems (when data on it is available in a trustworthy form) can inform evaluation\\nof their performance history. Similarly, faulty behavior in the Chainlink network\\ncan jeopardize revenue in these other systems by driving away users, i.e., FFO\\ncan extend across platforms.\\n9.6.2\\nSpeculative FFO\\nNode operators participate in the Chainlink network not just to generate revenue from\\noperations, but to create and position themselves to take advantage of new opportu-\\nnities to run jobs. In other words, expenditure by oracle nodes in the network is also\\na positive statement about the future of DeFi and other smart-contract application\\ndomains as well as emerging non-blockchain applications of oracle networks. Node op-\\nerators today earn the fees available on existing Chainlink networks and simultaneously\\nThese are loosely analogous to fake reviews on internet sites, except that the problem is easier in the\\noracle setting because we have a definitive record of whether the goods, i.e., reports, were ordered and\\ndelivered-as opposed to, e.g., physical goods ordered in online shops. Put another way, in the oracle\\nsetting, performance can be validated, even if customer veracity can’t.\\nbuild a reputation, performance history, and operational expertise that will position\\nthem advantageously to earn fees available in future networks (contingent, of course,\\non honest behavior). The nodes operating in the Chainlink ecosystem today will in this\\nsense have an advantage over newcomers in earning the fees as additional Chainlink\\nservices become available. This advantage applies to new operators, as well as tech-\\nnology companies with established reputations; for example, T-Systems, a traditional\\ntechnology provider (subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom), and Kraken, a large centralized\\nexchange, have established early presences in the Chainlink ecosystem [28, 143].\\nSuch participation by oracle nodes in future opportunities may be regarded itself\\nas a kind of speculative FFO, and thus constitutes a form of stake in the Chainlink\\nnetwork.\\n9.6.3\\nExternal Reputation\\nThe IIF as we have described it can operate in a network with strictly pseudonymous\\noperators, i.e., without disclosure of the people or real-world entities involved.\\nOne potentially important factor for user selection of providers, however, is external\\nreputation. By external reputation, we mean the perception of trustworthiness attach-\\ning to real-world identities, rather than pseudonyms. Reputational risk attaching to\\nreal-world identities can be viewed as a form of implicit incentive. We view reputation\\nthrough the lens of the IIF, i.e., in a cryptoeconomic sense, as a means of establishing\\ncross-platform activity that may be incorporated into FFO estimates.\\nThe benefit of using external reputation as a factor in estimates of FFO, as opposed\\nto pseudonymous linkage, is that external reputation links performance not just to an\\noperator’s existing activities, but also to future ones. If, for instance, a bad reputation\\nattaches to an individual person, it can taint that person’s future enterprises. Put an-\\nother way, external reputation can capture a broader swath of FFO than pseudonymous\\nperformance records, as the impact of malfeasance attaching to a person or established\\ncompany is harder to escape than that associated with a pseudonymous operation.\\nChainlink is compatible with decentralized identity technologies (Section 4.3) that\\ncan provide support for the use of external reputation in the IIF. Such technologies\\ncan validate and thereby help ensure the veracity of operators’ asserted real-world\\nidentities.19\\n9.6.4\\nOpen IIF Analytics\\nThe IIF, as we have noted, aims to provide reliable open-source data and tools for\\nimplicit-incentive analytics.\\nThe goal is to enable providers within the community\\nto develop analytics tailored to the risk-assessment needs of different parts of the\\nChainlink user base.\\n19Decentralized identity credentials can also, where desired, embellish pseudonyms with validated\\nsupplementary information. For example, a node operator could in principle use such credentials to\\nprove that it is a Fortune 500 company, without revealing which one.\\nA considerable amount of historical data regarding nodes’ revenue and performance\\nresides on chain in a high-trust, immutable form. Our goal, however, is to provide the\\nmost comprehensive possible data, including data on behaviors that are visible only off\\nchain, such as Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) or DON activity. Such data can potentially\\nbe voluminous. The best way to store it and ensure its integrity, i.e., protect it from\\ntampering, we believe, will be with the help of DONs, using techniques discussed\\nin Section 3.3.\\nSome incentives lend themselves to direct forms of measurement, such as staking\\ndeposits and basic FFO. Others, such as speculative FFO and reputation, are harder to\\nmeasure in an objective manner, but we believe that supporting forms of data, including\\nhistorical growth of the Chainlink ecosystem, social-media metrics of reputation, etc.,\\ncan support IIF analytics models even for these harder-to-quantify elements.\\nWe can imagine that dedicated DONs arise specifically to monitor, validate, and\\nrecord data relating to off-chain performance records of nodes, as well as other data\\nused in the IIF, such as validated identity information. These DONs can provide uni-\\nform, high-trust IIF data for any analytics providers serving the Chainlink community.\\nThey will also provide a golden record that makes the claims of analytics providers\\nindependently verifiable by the community.\\n9.7\\nPutting It All Together: Node Operator Incentives\\nSynthesizing our discussions above on explicit and implicit incentives for node operators\\nprovides a holistic view of the ways that node operators participate in and benefit from\\nthe Chainlink network.\\nAs a conceptual guide, we can express the total assets at stake by a given Chainlink\\nnode operator $S in a rough, stylized form as:\\n$S ≈$D + $F + $FS + $R,\\nwhere:\\n• $D is the aggregate of all explicitly deposited stake across all networks in which\\nthe operator participates;\\n• $F is the net present value of the aggregate of all FFO across all networks in\\nwhich the operator participates;\\n• $FS is the net present value of the speculative FFO of the operator; and\\n• $R is the reputational equity of the operator outside the Chainlink ecosystem\\nthat might be jeopardized by identified misbehavior in its oracle nodes.\\nWhile largely conceptual, this rough equality helpfully shows that there is a mul-\\ntiplicity of economic factors favoring high-reliability performance by Chainlink nodes.\\nAll of these factors other than $D are present in today’s Chainlink networks.\\n9.8\\nThe Virtuous Cycle of Economic Security\\nThe combination of super-linear staking impact with representation of fee payments\\nas future fee opportunity (FFO) in the IIF can lead to what we call the virtuous cycle\\nof economic security in an oracle network. This can be seen as a kind of economy\\nof scale. As the total amount secured by a particular network rises, the amount of\\nadditional stake it takes to add a fixed amount of economic security decreases as does\\nthe average per-user cost. It’s therefore cheaper, in terms of fees, for a user to join\\nan already-existing network than to achieve the same increase in network economic\\nsecurity by creating a new network. Importantly, the addition of each new user lowers\\nthe cost of the service for all previous users of that network.\\nGiven a particular fee structure (e.g. a particular yield rate on the amount staked),\\nif the total fees earned by a network increases, this incentivizes the flow of additional\\nstake into the network to secure it at a higher rate. Specifically, if the total stake\\nan individual node may hold in the system is capped, then when new fee payments\\nenter the system, raising its FFO, the number of nodes n will increase. Thanks to the\\nsuper-linear staking impact of our incentive system design, the economic security of\\nthe system will rise faster than n, e.g., as n2 in the mechanism we sketch in Section 9.4.\\nAs a result, the average cost for economic security-i.e., amount of stake contributing\\na dollar of economic security-will drop. The network can therefore charge its users\\nlower fees. Assuming that demand for oracle services is elastic (see, e.g., [31] for a brief\\nexplanation), demand will rise, generating additional fees and FFO.\\nWe illustrate this point with the following example.\\nExample 5. Since the economic security of an oracle network with our incentive\\nscheme is $dn2 for stake $dn, the economic security contributed by a dollar of stake\\nis n and thus the average cost per dollar of economic security-i.e, amount of stake\\ncontributing to a dollar of economic security-is 1/n.\\nConsider a network in which the economic incentives consist entirely of FFO, capped\\nat $d ≤$10K per node. Suppose the network has n = 3 nodes. Then the average cost\\nper dollar of economic security is about $0.33.\\nSuppose that the total FFO of the network rises above $30K (e.g., to $31K). Given\\nthe cap on per-node FFO, the network grows to (at least) n = 4. Now the average cost\\nper dollar of economic security drops to about $0.25.\\nWe illustrate the full virtuous cycle of economic security in oracle networks schemat-\\nically in Fig. 18.\\nWe emphasize that the virtuous cycle of economic security derives from the effect\\nof users pooling their fees.\\nIt is their collective FFO that works in favor of larger\\nnetwork sizes and thus greater collective security. We also note that the virtuous cycle\\nof economic security works in favor of DONs achieving financial sustainability. Once\\ncreated, DONs that address user needs should grow to and beyond the point at which\\nrevenue from fees exceed operational costs for oracle nodes.\\nFigure 18: Schematic of the virtuous cycle of Chainlink staking. A rise in user fee\\npayments to an oracle network 1⃝causes it to grow, leading to growth in its economic\\nsecurity 2⃝. This super-linear growth realizes economies of scale in Chainlink networks\\n3⃝. Specifically, it means a reduction in the average cost of economic security , i.e.,\\nthe per-dollar economic security arising from fee payments or other sources of stake\\nincreases. Lower costs, passed along to users, stimulate increased demand for oracle\\nservices 4⃝.\\n9.9\\nAdditional Factors Driving Network Growth\\nAs the Chainlink ecosystem continues to expand, we believe that its attractiveness\\nto users and importance as infrastructure for the blockchain economy will accelerate.\\nThe value provided by oracle networks is super-linear, meaning that it grows faster\\nthan the size of the networks themselves.\\nThis growth in value derives from both\\neconomies of scale-greater per-user cost efficiency as service volumes increase-and\\nnetwork effects-an increase of network utility as users adopt DONs more widely.\\nAs existing smart contracts continue to see more value secured and entirely new\\nsmart contract applications are made possible by more decentralized services, the total\\nuse of and aggregate fees paid to DONs should grow.\\nIncreasing pools of fees in\\nturn translate into the means and incentive to create even more decentralized services,\\nresulting in a virtuous cycle.\\nThis virtuous cycle solves a critical chicken-and-egg\\nproblem in the hybrid smart contract ecosystem: Innovative smart contract features\\noften require decentralized services that don’t yet exist (e.g., new DeFi markets often\\nrequire new data feeds) yet need sufficient economic demand to come into existence.\\nThe pooling of fees by various smart contracts for existing DONs will signal demand for\\nadditional decentralized services from a growing user base, giving rise to their creation\\nby DONs and an ongoing enablement of new and varied hybrid smart contracts.\\nIn summary, we believe that the growth in network security driven by virtuous\\ncycles in the Chainlink staking mechanism exemplifies larger patterns of growth that\\nthe Chainlink network can help bring about in an on-chain economy for decentralized\\nservices.\\nConclusion\\nIn this paper, we have set forth a vision for Chainlink’s evolution. The main theme\\nin this vision is oracle networks’ ability to provide a much broader range of service for\\nsmart contracts than mere data delivery. Using DONs as a foundation for the decentral-\\nized services of the future, Chainlink will aim to provide performant, confidentiality-\\nenhanced oracle functionality. Its oracle networks will offer strong trust minimization\\nthrough a combination of principled cryptoeconomic mechanisms such as staking and\\ncarefully conceived guard rails and service-level enforcement on relying main chains.\\nDONs will also help layer-2 systems enforce flexible, fair ordering policies on transac-\\ntions, as well as reduced gas costs for mempool-routed transactions. Taken together,\\nthese capabilities all drive in the direction of secure and richly functional hybrid smart\\ncontracts.\\nThe flexibility of DONs will enhance existing Chainlink services and give rise to\\nmany additional smart contract features and applications. Among these are seamless\\nconnection to a wide variety of off-chain systems, decentralized identity creation from\\nexisting data, priority channels to help ensure timely delivery of infrastructure-critical\\ntransactions, and confidentiality-preserving DeFi instruments.\\nThe vision we’ve set forth here is ambitious. In the short term, we seek to empower\\nhybrid contracts to accomplish goals beyond the reach of smart contracts today, while\\nin the long term we aim to realize a decentralized metalayer. Happily we can draw\\non new tools and ideas-ranging from consensus algorithms to zero-knowledge proof\\nsystems-that the community is developing as the fruit of rapidly evolving research.\\nSimilarly, we expect to prioritize implementation of the ideas in this paper in response\\nto the needs of Chainlink’s community of users. We look forward to the next stage\\nin our quest to empower smart contracts through universal connectivity and establish\\ndecentralized technologies as the backbone of the world’s next generation of financial\\nand legal systems.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThanks to Julian Alterini and Shawn Lee for rendering the figures in this paper.\\nReferences\\n[1] DeFi pulse. https://defipulse.com.

MIT Press Cambridge, 1995.\\nA\\nGlossary\\nThis glossary is intended to define important terms in the body of the paper. Square\\nbrackets denote the section of the main body of the paper (if any) in which a given\\nterm receives treatment. Boldface terms within definitions indicate a corresponding\\nglossary entry.\\n• Authenticated data origination (ADO) [Section 7.1]: The use of digital\\nsignatures by original data sources to authenticate data fed from their APIs. By\\nauthenticating data provenance, ADO can help strengthen the integrity of oracle\\nreports.\\n• Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT): A term used of distributed systems pro-\\ntocols such as blockchains. BFT is the property of ensuring security even if a\\n(minority) fraction of nodes / servers behave in a Byzantine, i.e., arbitrarily ma-\\nlicious, manner. The term Byzantine also conveniently describes the mechanics\\nof most Byzantine-Fault Tolerant protocols.\\n• Cryptoeconomics: A domain-specific form of mechanism that leverages cryp-\\ntographic techniques and digital assets to create desirable equilibria within de-\\ncentralized systems.\\n• DECO [Section 3.6.2]: Short for decentralized oracle, DECO is a new cryp-\\ntographic protocol that enables a user (or oracle) to prove statements in zero-\\nknowledge about data obtained from HTTPS-enabled servers.\\nDECO conse-\\nquently allows private data from unmodified web servers to be relayed safely by\\noracle networks. (It does not allow data to be sent by a prover directly on chain.)\\nDECO has narrower capabilities than Town Crier, but unlike Town Crier, does\\nnot rely on a trusted execution environment.\\n• Exchange: A platform for digital-asset trading. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes)\\nare exchanges realized in part or full as smart contracts.\\n• Fair Sequencing Services (FSS) [Section 5]: Chainlink’s functionality to bring\\nblockchain users the innovation of first-come, first-serve services like the kind\\nyou can get at a deli. FSS helps prevent front-running and other schemes that\\narbitrageurs use to gain a technical advantage over ordinary users in existing\\nsmart contract systems.\\n• Front-running: A profit-making strategy in financial systems such as public\\nblockchains in which a trader, observing an incoming transaction, exploits it by\\nspeedily placing her own transaction first. The term has a narrower meaning\\non Wall Street than in the blockchain community, but an even more thriving\\ncommunity of practitioners.\\n• Future fee opportunity: The net revenue a Chainlink oracle may expect to\\nreceive from service payments from customers in the future. Loss of such fees in\\ncases of malfeasance represents an opportunity cost.\\n• Game theory: Mathematically formal study of strategic interaction. A game\\nis a model of such an interaction, typically in the real world, that codifies sets of\\nactions available to participants in the game, known as players.\\n• Layer-2 systems: A class of approaches to improving the performance- both\\ntransaction throughput and latency-of blockchains.\\nLayer-2 systems involve\\noff-chain processing of transactions, followed by periodic reconciliation / syncing\\nwith the target blockchain. Rollups are one example.\\n• Mechanism / mechanism design (MD): Sometimes called “inverse game-\\ntheory,” MD is the science of designing games, called mechanisms, that incen-\\ntivize particular behaviors by participants, conventionally known as players.\\n• Public-key infrastructure (PKI): A system for secure creation and manage-\\nment of a mapping of identities to public keys.\\n• Rollup [Section 6.3]: A variant on the classical computer science transaction-\\nprocessing approach known as batching, now available in fruit flavors. Rollups\\ncan help increase transaction processing speeds and throughputs, and are a\\npromising approach to scaling blockchains to handle high transaction loads. A\\nrollup involves off-chain construction of batches of transactions, followed by on-\\nchain submission. Two popular rollup design approaches are:\\n- Optimistic rollups: A class of rollup schemes in which transaction batches\\nare submitted on chain without verification. Their correctness is enforced\\nby allowing participants to mount challenges to incorrect rollups, and using\\nstaking as an economic incentive for such challenges.\\n- zk-Rollups: A class of rollup schemes in which ‘zk’ inexplicably denotes\\n“zero-knowledge,” a property that zk-Rollups need not and often do not\\nhave. zk-Rollups use succinct arguments of knowledge, i.e., compact cryp-\\ntographic proofs or correct computation, to enable efficient verification when\\nsubmitted on chain.\\n• Super-linear / quadratic staking impact [Section 9.4.2]: An adversary can\\ncorrupt rational, i.e., incentive-driven, oracle nodes by bribing them. Given an\\nadversary with budget $B(n), and n participating oracle nodes, each with a fixed\\nstaking deposit $d, we say that a staking scheme has super-linear impact if adver-\\nsarial success requires B(n) that grows asymptotically faster than n. Quadratic\\nimpact means that B(n) grows asymptotically as n2.\\n• Staking [Section 9]: A means of reinforcing the security of a decentralized system\\nusing rigorously quantifiable economic incentives. In a staking scheme, partici-\\npants provide a cryptocurrency deposit that is partially or fully forfeited in cases\\nof participant deviation from a blockchain protocol. In the Chainlink setting,\\noracle nodes perform staking to ensure correct reports; they forfeit stake upon\\nfailure to produce a correct report.\\n• Transaction-Execution Framework (TEF) [Section 6]: A Decentralized Or-\\nacle Network framework for layer-2 systems that implements oracle support and\\nFair Sequencing Services.\\n• Town Crier [Section 3.6.2]: An oracle technology that uses a trusted execution\\nenvironment (TEE) to enforce integrity and confidentiality on oracle data and\\ncomputation. Town Crier has capabilities that subsume those of DECO, but\\nrequires trust in a TEE.\\n• Trusted Execution Environment (TEE): An execution environment for ap-\\nplications, often with special-purpose hardware support. A TEE aims to pro-\\nvide strong security properties such as confidentiality and application integrity,\\ni.e., tamper-resistance for software. TEEs are a work in progress, but one that\\npromises to have a large industry impact.\\n• Trust minimization [Section 7]: A common term in the blockchain industry\\ncleverly crafted to mean the opposite of what it sounds like it should mean. Trust\\nminimization refers to a desirable design feature in decentralized systems: Strong\\nassurance of correct behavior under limited assumptions about the trustworthi-\\nness of system components.\\nB\\nDON Interface: Further Details\\nIn this appendix, we provide more details on the DON interface outlined in Section 3.\\nWe treat the three computing resources of networking, computation, and storage re-\\nspectively in Appendix B.1, B.2, and B.3.\\nB.1\\nNetworking\\nOracle systems have arisen to address a limitation in basic blockchain protocols: public\\n/ permissionless blockchains cannot securely fetch data from external systems, such as\\nweb servers.20 DONs aim to support application-level adapters between blockchains\\nand off-chain systems in a general, flexible, and extensible form.\\nIn this section, we discuss the techniques DONs will use to construct secure adapters\\nand to ensure their availability. We also give some examples of their application. Most\\nof the techniques we describe have not been codified before in a Chainlink whitepaper.\\nThey can be applied in Chainlink as it is architected today, i.e., do not require DONs,\\nand we expect that some of them will be.\\n20Most data of interest is not digitally signed by the originating web server. Thus data fetched by a\\nsingle miner producing a block would be vulnerable to tampering. Even in committee-based consen-\\nsus protocols, e.g., [103, 120], there would be formidable challenges in realizing oracle functionality,\\nincluding data availability failures (and their potential impact on performance and/or transaction\\ncensorship), added low-level complexity, access restrictions on some data sources (e.g., proprietary\\nsources), etc.\\nWe characterize the security of an adapter in terms of the classic CIA (confiden-\\ntiality, integrity, availability) triad.\\nOf greatest importance in an oracle system is data integrity. Integrity here means\\nthat an adversary cannot tamper with data relayed from the source to the DON (or\\nvice versa). In some circumstances, a channel should also provide confidentiality. Con-\\nfidentiality means that an adversary learns only the data that a protocol is designed to\\nsend over the channel. (We provide more precise notions.) A channel should exhibit\\navailability, meaning that the channel is created and carries data in a timely way in\\nresponse to relying parties’ needs. Finally, as an addition to the triad, we note that\\naccountability is important to ensure the proper functioning of oracle systems: In cases\\nof failure, it should be possible to identify (and penalize) malfunctioning nodes.\\nB.1.1\\nIntegrity\\nTransport Layer Security (TLS)-the dominant internet protocol for establishing a se-\\ncure channel between a client and a host-has a serious inherent limitation: It provides\\nintegrity only for the two communicating parties. It does not digitally sign data in a\\nway that supports proof to a third party that data originated with the host (or client),\\nand proposals for this purpose, e.g., [9, 191], are currently seeing very limited adoption.\\nSome data of interest for blockchain systems may be digitally signed by its producers,\\nand we discuss approaches to support this potentially beneficial practice in Section 7.1.\\nToday, however, the vast majority of web data isn’t digitally signed.\\nDONs therefore incorporate purpose-built mechanisms for ensuring the integrity of\\na report r communicated to the DON from one or more other sources. These come in\\nthree forms, each with its own associated trust and operational model.\\nTo describe the functioning of the three mechanisms, we consider a simple model\\nin which players aim to ensure the integrity of what we call an enhanced report r =\\n(˜r, sid, S), where a basic report payload ˜r is tagged with: (1) sid, a session identifier\\nand (2) an identifier S for the source / entity with which the report originated. The\\nvalue sid provides a unique label for the protocol context in which ˜r is sent, and may\\ninclude such information as a unique identifier of the relying smart contract, an unique\\nidentifier of the query to which the report corresponds, etc. We refer to an enhanced\\nreport simply as a report where clear from context.\\nWe denote by ρi = (r [, w]) a report that an oracle node Oi writes to L, where w\\ndenotes an (optional) witness. We refer to w (with or without a witness) as a recorded\\nreport. Because players’ messages on L are authenticated, i.e., signed by the players\\nthat post them, writing ρi can serve as an endorsement by Oi in a relying protocol.\\nDONs support three basic mechanisms for ensuring the integrity of queries and\\nreports, meaning their being relayed from claimed source S without tampering. They\\nare:\\n• Cryptographic proofs: Digital signing of r by a source S with public key pk,\\ni.e., ρ = (r, w = Sigpk[r]), provides a direct assurance of the integrity of the\\nmessage.\\n• Trusted execution environments (TEEs) / Town Crier: An application\\ninstance A with public key pkA running in a fully featured TEE, such as Intel\\nSGX, can generate an attestation, that is, a digitally signed witness w = SigpkA[r].\\nAssuming trust in the TEE, then, the recorded report ρA = (r, w = SigpkA[r])\\nensures the integrity of r.\\n• Thresholding: Any subset of f + 1 players generating recorded reports ρi =\\n(r, Sigpki[r]) or combined or aggregate witness ρO = (r, SigO[r]) provides a collec-\\ntive view of r as originating correctly with source S.\\nThresholding and TEEs are complementary. They can be used simultaneously for\\na stronger combined security assurance, in the sense that integrity is assured if at least\\none of the two mechanisms is sound.\\nWe may extend our definition of integrity to encompass recording a transformation\\nconf(˜r) of ˜r, rather than ˜r itself. This extension is useful for confidentiality, as discussed\\nbelow.\\nUntrustworthy sources:\\nA given data source S may, of course, provide untrustwor-\\nthy data. Adapter integrity in the sense we have defined it does not include mechanisms\\nto address corrupt sources. The predominant mechanism used in oracle systems is ag-\\ngregation over sources. For example, if an asset’s price reports r1, r2, r3 are fetched\\nfrom sources S1, S2, S3, an aggregate report r = median(r1, r2, r3), given one faulty\\nsource, r will be the value reported by a correct source. Ensuring correct aggregation\\nis a problem of computation integrity, as discussed in Appendix B.2.\\nB.1.2\\nConfidentiality\\nWe say that an adapter has weak confidentiality if O learns both the query q and report\\ndata r generated by the adapter. Weakly confidential protocols may still provide other\\nforms of confidentiality, however: the adapter may place only partial information about\\n(q, r) on L and thus partially conceal (q, r) from an observer, and auxiliary data in the\\nprotocol may still be confidential.\\nWe say an adapter has strong confidentiality, on the other hand, if q and r are\\npartially or fully concealed from O. It’s not obvious at first glance how to achieve\\nstrong confidentiality: How, after all, can O process a hidden query and manage a\\nhidden report?\\nDONs can use DECO [234] and/or Town Crier [233] to achieve strong confidentiality\\nin adapters. See Appendix C for an example.\\nDECO and Town Crier are designed to provide legacy compatibility, i.e., the ability\\nto use existing data sources, in a confidentiality-preserving way. An alternative ap-\\nproach is to change the output of data sources by digitally signing it and providing\\nconfidentiality features, as in TLS-N [191], a nicely complementary approach that we\\nwill also explore, and to a limited extent in OpenID Connect [9], an identity-oriented\\ndata-signing protocol that runs on top of OAuth 2.0.\\nB.1.3\\nAvailability\\nThe availability of an adapter depends on both the availability of the system to which it\\nis connecting as well as the availability of the DON nodes responsible for implementing\\nthe adapter. While availability mechanisms may be adapter-specific, we expect that\\nthey will commonly rely on a few basic techniques already used or slated for inclusion\\nin the current version of Chainlink. One, of course, is redundancy, i.e., having multiple\\nnodes operate the channel. Another is the use of cryptoeconomic incentives to reinforce\\nfast channel operation; for example, while redundant nodes receive payment for their\\nservices, a premium may be paid for fast execution, e.g., a reward for the first node to\\nrelay data to the DON from an off-chain system.\\nSee Appendix B.1 for further details on adapters in DONs.\\nB.2\\nComputation\\nIn their support of layer-2 scaling approaches-whether based on optimistic computing\\nor validity proofs-DONs offer the possibility of significant performance improvements\\nfor smart contracts. By employing additional technologies, DONs can provide further\\nperformance enhancement and also support various forms of confidentiality, whether\\nfor oracle data as an adjunct to privacy-preserving layer-2 schemes (e.g., [217]), or to\\nprovide privacy enhancement for schemes in which it isn’t present.\\nZero-knowledge proof (argument) systems, such as zk-SNARKs [126], zk-STARKs [38],\\nand Bulletproofs [56, 66], are powerful tools for privacy and will play an important role\\nin the evolution of confidentiality-preserving smart contract systems [149], as they do,\\nfor instance, in DECO. It is worth noting that the goal of proving statements in zero-\\nknowledge to an oracle node admits use of a new form of zero-knowledge proof with a\\ndesignated verifier (i.e., a proof that is verifiable only by a particular entity, not pub-\\nlicly) [220]; such schemes can greatly outperform more general-purpose zero-knowledge\\nproof systems. We expect that zero-knowledge proofs will play an important role in\\ntrustworthy and confidential relaying of oracle results, in both adapters and executa-\\nbles. But they have a critical limitation: They don’t conceal secrets from the prover.\\nTo enable more general confidentiality-preserving functionality will require addi-\\ntional techniques. These same techniques can also enforce integrity, i.e., help ensure\\nthat computation is performed correctly. We briefly discuss the roles of Trusted Exe-\\ncution Environments (TEEs) and Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) in the evo-\\nlution of Chainlink.\\nB.2.1\\nTrusted Execution Environments (TEEs)\\nTEEs such as Intel SGX [229, 133] and Keystone [152] allow applications to exe-\\ncute within a protected environment, known as an enclave, that in principle protects\\nboth their integrity and confidentiality. TEEs are designed to realize a powerful and\\nvery general functionality [183], one that encompasses even powerful cryptographic\\nprimitives such as virtual black-box obfuscation, that are provably unrealizable using\\ncryptography alone [27, 175].\\nThe idea of leveraging TEEs for smart contracts was introduced in [139, 233] and\\nseveral general-purpose frameworks for this purpose have since emerged [58, 80, 99].\\nWe expect that TEEs will eventually play a role in the Chainlink network, as\\nthey are the basis for Town Crier [233], and Chainlink already supports TEE-based\\nblockchain systems, e.g., [8]. As the technology continues to mature, we believe it will\\nplay an increasingly important role in blockchain systems in general, and Chainlink in\\nparticular.\\nConcerns about TEE security have been one impediment to their adoption. We\\ntherefore briefly discuss this issue.\\nB.2.2\\nTEE Security\\nRecent attacks against Intel SGX, the only commodity TEE with attestation capabil-\\nities, e.g., [211, 212], have cast doubt on the security of TEEs in practice. We believe\\nthat the technology will evolve, particularly with open source efforts emerging [152].\\nMitigations:\\nIt is possible to deploy TEEs in ways that recognize their potential\\nfor compromise.\\nOne is to employ them for defense-in-depth, that is, for harden-\\ning systems. Town Crier may be viewed in this light: Trustworthy oracle operators\\nshould provide their users with confidentiality and integrity, but use of Town Crier\\nstrengthens this assurance. Similarly, TEEs can be deployed in ways that don’t rely\\non perfect security. Sealed-glass proofs [207], for instance, use TEEs for integrity, but\\nnot confidentiality (although recent side-channel attacks compromise both).\\nFinally, it is possible to design TEE-based protocols with forward security, such that\\nif a break becomes known: (1) Players can avoid use of the TEE and (2) The break\\ndoes not retroactively impact previous protocol invocations.\\nThis approach would\\ngreatly limit the window of opportunity for adversaries to exploit TEE vulnerabilities.\\nFor example, in protocols where a TEE controls users’ funds, users might move those\\nfunds into addresses specifically for temporary, TEE-only use. In protocols where TEEs\\nenforce confidentiality for long-lived data, frequent key rotation would achieve a similar\\ngoal.\\nFor example, a TEE could be used to implement the ConfSwitch adapter for confi-\\ndential DeFi discussed in Appendix C.3. The TEE ingests (q, switch) encrypted under\\na public key pkTEE(t) for an epoch t lasting, e.g., a week, and generates the output\\ns = switch(r).\\nIt then purges all the data it has processed.\\nAt the beginning of\\neach new epoch, it deletes its old key, generates a new one, and publishes it to L or\\nMAINCHAIN. (Such publication could be facilitated by an executable on L with a\\nper-epoch initiator.) Players can additionally abort by agreement at any time.\\nOf course, users have exposure in this model to zero-day, i.e., unpublished, attacks.\\nThere is a cost to using a zero-day attack, however, namely the risk of its exposure\\nand invalidation through publication of a patch.\\nB.2.3\\nSecure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)\\nMPC is a term for generic computation on secret-shared values by a set of nodes. MPC\\nenables realization of a “black box” functionality, i.e., computation of a function g on\\nconfidential inputs x1, . . . , xz such that players learn only g(x1, . . . , xz), and learn no\\ninformation about the inputs to the function or intermediate computations. Inputs\\ncan be secret-shared, and also represented in a binding but confidential way on chain\\nusing a commitment scheme or encryption under a secret-shared key.\\nWhile quite flexible, and despite impressive recent advances, generic MPC-i.e.,\\nMPC that supports any function g-incurs very high computation and communication\\noverhead by comparison with direct execution on a single node. For example, MPC\\nusing fairly state-of-the-art tools operating in an adversarial model with malicious\\nplayers-such as EMP toolkit [218, 219]-require about 20 seconds of computation\\nfor a single AES evaluation for 14 nodes on a WAN. (Only 250ms of computation is\\nonline; the rest can be performed in a precomputation phase.) By comparison, an AES\\nevaluation on a modern, consumer-grade CPU requires around 2µs [213].\\nIn short, generic MPC is reasonably practical, but only for modest computations.\\nPractical implementations have tended to focus on relatively modest computational\\ntasks, such as auctions in Hyperledger Fabric [42].\\nConsiderably more efficient protocols can be realized for certain functions g. One\\nexample is threshold signing, which is especially practical for BLS signatures [54].\\n2PC, computation involving just two players can leverage special techniques (“garbled\\ncircuits”) that makes it considerably more efficient than computation involving n > 2\\nplayers. DECO [234], for example, uses both custom and generic 2PC techniques.\\nMost MPC schemes and implementations have some important limitations. One is\\nthat a single player can abort the protocol and learn its output, while (anonymously)\\npreventing other players from learning theirs’. This means a failure of robustness (ability\\nto complete computation) but also fairness (in an MPC-specific sense), meaning that\\nall players receive outputs or none does.\\nSchemes that allow identification of aborting players (ID-MPC), e.g., [37] are one\\napproach to this problem. But MPC protocols also generally make the strong assump-\\ntion of network synchrony, without which they may experience both confidentiality\\nand integrity failures. A reasonably practical robust version of MPC that operates in\\nasynchronous networks is presented in [157].\\nAnother limitation of most MPC protocols is their lack of public verifiability. This\\nisn’t problematic in a model that assumes a quorum of honest players, but would be\\nfor the type of MAINCHAIN accountability discussed in Section 7.3 and Section 8.3.\\nTo ensure correct MPC outputs in the case of a failure in a majority of nodes requires\\nuse of publicly verifiable variants such as [37] with a public bulletin board-necessarily\\nMAINCHAIN in a majority-dishonest model-and is thus not terribly practical.\\nIn summary, we expect that DONs will support MPC for specialized computations,\\nsuch as threshold signing and DECO, early in their development. We will track devel-\\nopments in the fast-moving field of MPC to determine where support for generic MPC\\nmay be appropriate.\\nB.3\\nStorage\\nData sent to blockchains can play a multifarious role. It may be consumed immediately\\nby contracts. It can alternatively be placed on chain for fast future access by contracts\\nor for purposes not related to contract execution, such as archival storage facilitating\\nthe audit of off-chain systems.\\nThe quantities of data required for these last two\\npurposes greatly exceeds that consumed by contracts today, as well as the data-storage\\ncapacity of most permissionless blockchains.\\nWe envision DONs accommodating two forms of storage. The first is on-ledger\\nstorage, achieved by inclusion within a DON’s ledger. The second option, particularly\\nattractive for bulk storage, is off-ledger storage.\\nOff-ledger storage may involve the use of off-chain systems that are innately de-\\ncentralized, such as Filecoin [188], IPFS [40], Storj [226], or Sia [215]. Filecoin has a\\nbuilt-in protocol called Proof of Replication (PoReps) [74, 112, 111, 188, 199], designed\\nto ensure storage of multiple copies of a file F (and prevent miners from gaming the\\nconsensus protocol).\\nThe other three can only achieve this property by having an\\nend user encrypt F multiple times under different keys, creating distinct correspond-\\ning ciphertexts ˜F1, ˜F2, ˜F3. A DON can perform such encryption on behalf of a user,\\npermitting proof of replication without native support in a target storage protocol.\\nWhere compatible with users’ desired trust models, it is also possible to use existing\\nsystems, such as conventional cloud storage providers. Replication across such services\\nis possible for robustness [57] and complementary to and composable with decentralized\\nstorage services.\\nConfidentiality:\\nDONs include the ability for O to store data encrypted under a\\nsecret-shared key. They can perform confidentiality-preserving computation over such\\ndata, as discussed above in Appendix B.2.\\nB.4\\nResource Pricing\\nAccurate charging of users for resource use on blockchains remains a perennial chal-\\nlenge. Mispriced resources do not merely carry the risk of discouraging important ap-\\nplications within an ecosystem. They also constitute a security risk, as they can enable\\ndenial-of-service attacks [184] and more subtle attacks such as drainage of funds [222].\\nResource pricing of executable logic in a DON is a somewhat easier problem, as\\nDON nodes control resource usage and can apply whatever pricing strategies they\\ndeem appropriate. Possible approaches include market-driven pricing, gas metering `a la\\nEthereum, which is supported in EVM and WASM [3], and language-driven approaches\\nsuch as non-Turing-complete languages [131]-potentially along with bounded code\\nsizes. Pricing of adapters, however, will certainly require application-specific pricing\\nstrategies, as adapters access external resources, e.g., cloud storage, whose cost is\\nDON-independent.\\nC\\nAdapter Examples\\nIn this appendix, we give a few examples of adapters, to illustrate both the wide variety\\nthat is desirable and achievable in practice and relevant notions of security and the\\ntechniques to enforce them.\\nWe use the notation Adapter(P, S) to denote an adapter that involves players in P\\nand a set of data sources (or a single data source) S. We let →T denote an input /\\noutput to system T where there’s ambiguity. Otherwise inputs should be understood\\nas read by an adapter from L and outputs as written to L.\\nC.1\\nOracle-Mediated Data-Source Access (MediatedReport)\\nIn some cases, certain nodes may have access to a data source S that the full set of\\nnodes O does not. For example, some nodes may have API keys or other credentials\\nthat other nodes in O lack. Nodes with privileged access to a data source S can mediate\\naccess on behalf of O using DECO (or Town Crier). Here we describe an adapter that\\ndoes so with weak confidentiality.\\nTechnical approach:\\nUsing DECO, it is possible for a particular Oi to access S\\nusing confidential credentials and prove to another node Oj that it correctly relayed a\\nreport r from S, without revealing its credentials to Oj. This approach can be scaled\\nof course to proofs across subsets of nodes.\\nAdapter MediatedReport(O, S)\\nInput: q\\nOutput: ⟨medreport : (q, r); Oi⟩\\nSecurity:\\n• Availability: Oi must be available when invoked by players in O that\\nlack access to S.\\n• Integrity: r is correct under the cryptographic hardness assumptions of\\nDECO and assuming at least k honest nodes in O.\\nExample application:\\nSuppose Oi submits a report r from data source S whose\\nvalue is disputed by another node or nodes in O. This might occur, for instance, as\\npart of the dispute mechanism in a staking protocol.\\nThe dispute might be arbitrated by invoking the full set of nodes in O. Some nodes\\nin O, however, may lack access to S, which may be a specialized data source. Using\\nDECO, it is possible for Oi to prove to nodes in O that its report r was correctly relayed\\nfrom S, without other nodes having direct access to S.\\nVariants and extensions:\\nTown Crier offers an alternative way to achieve the same\\nadapter. The credentials of Oi can be placed in Town Crier instances run by individual\\noracle nodes in O, with appropriate restrictions on their use [164].\\nIt is also possible to extend MediatedReport so that O may call any node in O∗, a\\nsubset of nodes with access to S. It is also possible to generalize MediatedReport to\\ninvolve nodes on MAINCHAIN. Such a variant can be helpful in protocols, e.g., staking\\nor optimistic rollups, e.g. [141], that use on-chain arbitration of off-chain computation.\\nC.2\\nCross-Ledger Reports (XL-Report-Read)\\nFor many applications, it can be useful to exchange data across DONs.\\nHere we\\ndescribe a simple adapter to import a basic report from a DON B to another DON A.\\nFor simplicity, we assume a unique report of the form ⟨report : (q, r)⟩on LB for any\\ngiven q.\\nTechnical approach:\\nAs messages on a ledger LB are signed with respect to pkLB,\\nthey can easily be authenticated by the set of oracle nodes OA operating Decentralized\\nOracle Network A if they know pkLB.\\nAdapter XL-Report-Read(OA, LB)\\nInput: (q, pkLB) →LA, for query q and target DON public key pkLB\\nOutput: ⟨XLreport : (q, r); pkLB⟩→LA.\\nSecurity:\\n• Availability: At least one node in OA must have access to LB.\\n• Integrity: r’s correctness depends upon an honest OB.\\nExample application:\\nA DON A may determine that it has sufficient trust in DON\\nB to treat its reports as trustworthy. In this case, it may be more cost-effective to\\nimport certain reports than to generate them independently.\\nPKI support:\\nThe main challenge in securing report transfer between DONs is\\nmaintenance of a supporting public-key infrastructure (PKI), that is, a trustworthy,\\nup-to-date mapping of public keys to DONs. To support this essential functionality\\nin Chainlink, we plan to maintain smart-contract-based directories of Decentralized\\nOracle Networks and their public keys on all blockchains that Chainlink supports.\\nVariants and extensions:\\nOf course, many other possible cross-DON adapters are\\npossible. For example, DON A may have permission in DON B to import confidential\\ndata from LB. In this case, the adapter would require participation from OB. As\\nanother example, DON A may have selective write permissions on DON B, in which\\ncase a cross-chain adapter for writing data would be possible.\\nOther extensions are possible to handle multiple or ambiguous reports on LB. For\\nexample, XL-Report-Read could relay the message M =\\n(q, ∗), z\\nwith the highest\\nindex z on LB at a given time t.\\nC.3\\nConfidential Switch (ConfSwitch)\\nOur previous two examples did not provide on-ledger confidentiality of q or r. We\\nnow describe one that does: ConfSwitch. This adapter reveals on chain only a function\\nswitch of an aggregate (medianized) report r, and is thus appropriate for price feeds. It\\nprovides on-ledger confidentiality for q and r, revealing only a function of the latter. It\\nalso enables recording of confidential data for an auditor (with public key pkaud). Such\\nauditing may be important, as the details of transactions that use ConfSwitch are not\\nvisible on the ledger or main chain. The data made available to the auditor includes\\nq, switch, and optional auxiliary data α.\\nTechnical approach:\\nTo provide confidentiality for q and switch (and optionally α),\\nthey are encrypted under the public keys of O and the auditor. O accumulates reports\\noffledger and aggregates them into a report r, and outputs switch(r). Neither q nor\\nany report data are written explicitly on L.\\nStrong confidentiality:\\nStrong confidentiality is achievable in ConfSwitch using\\nDECO or Town Crier.\\nIn such a variant, players place on L the commitment c = comm(q, switch) to the\\nquery and switch. Either player can then use DECO or Town Crier to retrieve reports\\nand prove in zero knowledge their correctness with respect to c. As DECO enables\\nsuch proofs only for individual reports, an additional step would be required: The user\\nwould prove the correctness of ciphertexts on individual reports and then prove the\\ncorrectness of a claimed output switch(r), i.e., correct medianization and application\\nof switch to the reports.\\nAdapter ConfSwitch (O, S)\\nInput: EncpkO[q, switch], Encpkaud[q, switch, α]\\nOutput: ⟨ConfSwitch : switch(r)⟩, for r = median({ri}i : Oi∈O)\\nSecurity:\\n• Confidentiality: The adapter reveals Mixicle execution details to O, but\\nonly switch(r) to observers of L and MAINCHAIN.\\n• Availability: Availability depends on full availability of S (although vari-\\nants are possible that rely on a threshold subset of S).\\n• Integrity: r’s correctness depends upon cryptographic hardness assump-\\ntions, the honesty of O, and the accuracy of reports from S.\\nFigure 19: Adapter ConfSwitch\\nD\\nFunctional Signatures\\nA functional (digital) signature scheme [59], like a conventional signature, has a master\\n(private) key sk that permits signing of any message. Additionally, however, the master\\nkey can be used to create a signing key skF, for a function F, that permits signing of\\nany value y in the range of F, i.e. such that F(x) = y for some input x.\\nA simple way to realize this primitive, given in [59], is as follows (with slight modi-\\nfication). A fresh key pair (sk′, pk′) is generated. To create the key skF for function F\\nis computed as:\\nskF =\\nsk′, cert = Sigsk(pk′ ∥F)\\n,\\nwhere cert here may be viewed as a “certificate” stating that pk′ is a valid public key\\nfor a functional signature with function F and master public key pk.\\nA signature on message y using skF, then, takes the form:\\nSig∗\\nskF (y) = (cert, Sigsk′(y), x).\\nTo verify Sig∗\\nskF (y), i.e., compute verify∗\\nSig∗\\nskF (y)\\n, a verifier checks that F(x) = y,\\nand also checks the validity of cert and Sigsk′(y) in the obvious way.\\nThe value x (the “witness”) can in principle be large-as in the oracle-oriented\\nuse cases we consider. A straightforward remedy [59] that is computationally efficient\\nfor the verifier is to substitute for x a SNARK (or zk-SNARK for confidentiality)-a\\ncompact proof (argument) of the existence of x.\\nFunctional signatures are conceptually straightforward, as are their basic construc-\\ntions. But they provide a useful framework for reasoning about combining source data\\nin oracle networks.\\nD.1\\nFunctional Signatures for Combining Data\\nReturning to Example 4, we can see how a functional signature might be applied\\nto create a proof σ that a value v was correctly computed from the value-signature\\nset pair (V, Σ). Let (ski, pki) denote the signing key pair for data source Si in S =\\n{S1, S2, . . . , SnS}. Suppose pk is a public key for S whose corresponding private key\\nis shared in a threshold manner among data sources; for simplicity, assume ski is Si’s\\nshare of sk.\\nWe can then define a functional signature that medianizes a set of nS validly signed\\nvalues as follows:\\nF(V, Σ) =\\n(\\nmedian(V )\\nif ∀i ∈{1 . . . nS}, verify(pki, σi, vi) = true\\n⊥\\notherwise.\\n)\\nA functional signature scheme with master key sk, then, can be used to transmit a\\ncorrectly computed median value v to SC. The oracle network computes σ∗= Sig∗\\nskF (v),\\nand sends it to SC, which verifies it by computing verify∗(σ∗, pk, v).\\nOf course, to improve robustness to data source failures, F can be relaxed to medi-\\nanize a subset of at least kS validly signed values for some threshold kS ≤nS, i.e., to\\naccept valid signatures from a quorum of sources, as we do in our example constructions\\nbelow.\\nD.2\\nDiscretized Functional Signatures\\nComputing σ∗using a SNARK-based function-signature construction is a computa-\\ntionally intensive task that may be incompatible with high performance DON ap-\\nplications. We therefore propose a relaxed variant we call discretized functional sig-\\nnatures, the key idea of which is to place a grid over the space of possible signed\\nvalues, and constrain the values to that grid. For example if the required answer is\\na single scalar, the grid could be all the integer multiples of some grid size a ∈R+,\\naZ = {. . . , −3a, −2a, −a, 0, a, 2a, 3a, . . .}. Then a valid signed value is a representation\\nof some az for z ∈Z plus a valid signature over az.\\nThe value az need not be the precise answer F(V, Σ), but will be close to it. To\\nformalize this, in addition to the predicate function F from Appendix D.1, the specifi-\\ncation of a discretized functional signature has an additional pair of parameters (δ, δ′),\\ncorresponding to how coarse/fine the constraining grid is. They are as follows:\\n• The parameter δ bounds permitted deviation from the correct output of F. In-\\nformally,21 given a pair (V, Σ), we require that it be infeasible for an adversarial\\nsigner (the DON, for our purposes) to generate a signature σ∗that deviates from\\nthe correct output of F(V, Σ) by more than δ, i.e., such that:\\nverify∗(σ∗, pk, v)\\n^\\n(|F(V, Σ) −v| > δ) .\\n• The parameter δ′ characterizes how precisely some quorum of values in V must\\nmatch, for a feasible signature to be guaranteed. I.e., a functional signature σ∗\\ncan always be constructed, given kS signers {Szi}kS\\ni=1 with observations {vzi} such\\nthat |vzi −vzj| ≤δ′ for all i, j.\\nThus, δ may loosely be viewed as a soundness parameter, while δ′ is a completeness\\nparameter, in the sense that it specifies that signatures can always be constructed from\\nobservations v = (v1, . . . , vkS) by honest participants as long as v lies within δ′ of the\\ndiagonal in V kS-space, under the max norm, i.e. so the larger δ′ is, the larger the set\\nof signable observation sets is.\\nRecall our assumption that ski is a secret share of sk. In describing an example\\nconstruction, we further assume that Sig is a non-interactive threshold signature, e.g.,\\na BLS signature [54]. In an example below, we will use (kS, nS)-threshold signatures\\nfor some threshold kS ≤nS such that kS > 2\\n3nS.\\nWith this machinery, we can build efficient functional signatures for a variety of\\ndifferent message spaces. The idea, briefly, is for data sources collectively-but non-\\ninteractively-to compute partial (kS, nS)-threshold signatures on grid values azi ∈aZ\\nin the neighborhood of their respective individual values vi.\\nIn this way, the data\\nsources in S collectively constrain v, without explicitly computing it. If at least kS\\ndata sources emit values vi that are sufficiently close, their neighboring grid values will\\nhave a common element which they have all signed, collectively creating a threshold\\nsignature on a grid point within a δ-bounded neighborhood of a valid v = F(V, Σ). A\\nsignature Sig∗\\nsk(v) for v = az is simply a threshold signature on az ∈aZ.\\nWe illustrate by way of example, describing a construction for medianizing. It is\\nconvenient here to define a cell for aZ as an interval of values contained within a pair\\nof successive grid points, i.e., [az, a(z + 1)].\\nExample 6 (Discretized functional signature for median). Suppose the value to be\\nsigned is a price quote (e.g., the USD price of ETH), and can thus be represented as a\\npositive integer in Z+ (e.g., denominated in some fraction of US dollars such as cents).\\nFor the function F(V, Σ) that medianizes a set of at least kS signed source values, the\\nfollowing construction achieves (δ = a, δ′ = a) for any a ∈N.\\nLet\\n21A more formal security definition would require application of the “discretized” property to the\\nexistential unforgeability under a chosen message attack (EUF-CMA) for threshold signatures, for\\nwhich see, e.g. [118].\\nι(vi)\\n=\\na⌊vi/a⌋,\\nι′(vi)\\n=\\nι(vi) + a,\\ni.e., [ι(vi), ι′(vi)] is the highest cell in the grid aZ which contains vi.\\nEach data source Si emits a signature σi of the following form:\\nσi = (σ(1)\\ni , σ(2)\\ni , σ(3)) =\\nSigski\\nι(vi)\\n, Sigski\\nι(vi)\\n, Sigski\\nvi\\nA signature σi is valid if all the constituent signatures σ(j)\\ni\\nare valid, and the mes-\\nsages in σ(1)\\ni , σ(2)\\ni\\nare equal to ι(vi), ι′(vi), where vi is the message in σ(3)\\ni .22\\nA functional signature Sig∗\\nsk(v) = F({vi}, {σi}) can be constructed from the signa-\\ntures {σi}i if there is a common grid point v = az ∈aZ on which some sufficiently\\nlarge subset of {σ(1)\\ni , σ(2)\\ni }i contains partial signatures.\\nThe scheme in Example 6 achieves δ = a and δ′ = a for the median function\\nF(V, Σ) that medianizes a set of at least kS signed source values, as we will show in\\nthe following lemmas.\\nLemma 1. Given a valid discretized functional signature on v ∈aZ, constructed from\\nkS partial signatures on v,\\nn\\nσi = (Sigski(ι(vi)), Sigski(ι′(vi)), Sigski(vi))\\nokS\\ni=1 ,\\nit follows that each vi lies in [v −a, v + a].\\nProof. Since {σi} can be used to construct a functional signature on v, we must have\\nv ∈{ι(vi), ι′(vi)} for each i. Thus one of the following is true:\\nv = ι(vi)\\n= a⌊vi/a⌋\\n=⇒vi ∈[v, v + a]\\nv = ι′(vi)\\n= a⌊vi/a⌋+ a\\n=⇒vi ∈[v −a, v]\\nTherefore, vi ∈[v −a, v] ∪[v, v + a] = [v −a, v + a].\\n22σ(3)\\ni\\n= Sigski(vi) is not necessary for the correctness of this construction, but including it avoids\\ndistracting questions about what the median of the observations is, when\\n• a dishonest oracle Si could attest to arbitrary grid cell boundaries irrespective of its observed\\nvalue vi, or even without having observed any value vi at all, or\\n• an aggregator of the partial signatures could choose an arbitrary kS-sized subset of the σi’s\\nfrom which to construct the functional signature\\nIt is not hard to optimize this construction to work with only Σ = {(σ(1)\\ni\\n, σ(2)\\ni\\n)}, and show that the\\nrange of possible values for the median implied by the resulting functionally-signed value covers all\\npossible actual median values, as long as less than nS\\nanswers are dishonest. It requires the minor\\n(but distracting) ontological gymnastics of reassigning inaccurately-reported/nonsensical/nonexistent\\nvalues of V to arbitrary integers.\\nLemma 2. Let {vi}m\\ni=1 be a set of observations, and let I ⊂{1, . . . , m} be a subset of in-\\ndices which constitute a majority. The median of {vi} lies in [min({vi}i∈I), max({vi}i∈I)].\\nProof. Without loss of generality, assume the observations v1, . . . , vm are sorted. The\\nsubsequence\\narg min\\ni∈I\\nvi, . . . , arg max\\ni∈I\\nvi\\nis longer than m\\n2 , since |I| > m\\n2 . Therefore, the midpoint(s)23 of the sequence 1, . . . , m\\nlie(s) in subsequence, and thus the median lies in [min({vi}i∈I), max({vi}i∈I)].\\nLemma 3. Given a valid discretized functional signature on v ∈aZ, from a set of\\nnS signers {Si}, more than two thirds of which are honest, and a signature threshold\\nkS > 2\\n3nS, the true median lies in [v −a, v + a].\\nProof. By lemma 1, all the vi’s used by honest signers lie in [v −a, v + a]. While\\ndishonest signers could have signed v on the basis of any observation (or even no\\nobservation), the honest participants form a majority of the signers, so by lemma 2 the\\nmedian observation lies between two honest values in [v −a, v + a], and therefore itself\\nlies in [v −a, v + a]. (The honest signers form a majority because at least kS > 2\\n3nS\\nsigned, but the number of dishonest participants in the signing group is assumed to be\\nless than 1\\n3nS = 1\\n2 × 2\\n3nS < kS\\n2 .)\\nLemma 4. The discretized functional signature scheme in Example 6 achieves δ = a\\nfor the medianization function.\\nProof. By lemma 3, the true median lies in [v −a, v + a]. All points in this interval are\\nless than a units from v, so the distance from v to the true median is less than a. I.e.,\\nthe condition from the definition of δ which we desire to be infeasible,\\nverify∗(σ∗, pk, v)\\n^\\n(|F(V, Σ) −v| > δ) .\\nis indeed infeasible, for δ = a.\\nLemma 5. The discretized functional signature scheme in Example 6 achieves δ′ = a.\\nI.e., given a quorum of at least kS signers Q = {Si} with observations |vi −vj| < a\\nfor Si, Sj ∈Q, a valid discretized functional signature can be constructed from their\\nsignatures {σi = (Sigski(ι(vi)), Sigski(ι′(vi)), Sigski(vi))}\\nProof. Let I = [min({vi}i), max({vi}i)] be the smallest interval containing {vi}i. Since\\nthe length of I, | max({vi}i) −min({vi}i)|, is a difference between two elements of {vi}\\nit is less than a. Thus I contains at most one point of aZ. If it contains one, say v,\\nthen v ∈{ι(vi), ι′(vi)} for all I, because each vi lies in either the cell below or the cell\\nabove v. Therefore a functional signature on v can be constructed from the σi’s. If it\\ndoes not, it lies entirely within one cell of aZ, and {ι(vi), ι′(vi)} will be the same for\\nall i, so a functional signature can be constructed on either boundary value.\\n23There are two midpoints if m is even, m\\n2 and m\\n2 + 1, and one midpoint if m is odd, m\\n2 + 1.\\nThe technique in Example 6 can be viewed as a means of reducing proximity testing\\nto equality testing by discretizing values within a lattice. Greater resilience to variance\\n(in the sense of larger δ′) can be achieved if participants send signatures over a larger\\nset of grid points in the neighborhood of their observed vi’s.\\nEnriching the discretized functional signature:\\nAs described here, a signature\\nSig∗\\nsk(v) is on a grid point v ∈aZ, and v will be close to but not necessary equal to\\nthe median vmed computed over a set of at least kS node-supplied values. It is possible,\\nhowever, for a DON also to include vmed in its signed message. If vmed is computed by\\nthe DON, then it is a trustworthy value assuming the DON is functioning correctly. In\\nsome cases, contracts may wish to consume vmed if |v −vmed| ≤a, use v as assurance\\nagainst gross inaccuracy of vmed.\\nE\\nProspective Bribery\\nOne class of adversarial behavior we expressly designed our proposed staking mech-\\nanisms to protect against is what we call prospective bribery. This novel attack is a\\ngeneralization of the bribery attacks described in [166]. Prospective bribes are feasi-\\nble in and can impact the security of proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, and permissioned\\nsystems.\\nIn proof-of-work and proof-of-stake blockchains, a prospective briber commits to\\npaying the creator of a future block a specified bribe given that the future block meets\\nsome specified condition. For example, a briber could post a bribe to ensure that a\\nfuture block does not include a specific transaction, or includes a specified ordering.\\nWe use the term prospective because the briber actually does not know which node\\nwill be chosen to lead the protocol in the relevant round.\\nStill, the bribe can be\\nsuccessful as long as the candidates for that leadership role are aware of the bribe.\\nTo grasp the impact of prospective bribery in the context of staking, consider a\\nstaking mechanism for an oracle network in which there is a pool of n oracles, and\\nin each round a node is selected at random-using fresh randomness-to unilaterally\\nreport the next value. It may appear that this strategy is naturally resistant to bribery\\nattack, as a briber might have no way to determine ahead of time which node to bribe.\\nHowever a briber can offer a guaranteed bribe to whichever node is selected as leader\\nof the target block, promising a payment if and only if the block returns false (to use\\nthe language of Section 9).\\nA briber can guarantee payment of a prospective bribe using a smart contract\\nanalogous to those shown in [166].\\nF\\nRandom vs. Committee-Based Oracle Selection\\nIt is possible to operate an oracle network in a permissionless or quasi-permissionless\\nway, selecting a random subcommittee ˜O ⊂O producing a given report r or sequence of\\nreports. An ostensible benefit of this approach is its resistance to attacks that corrupt\\nnodes, whether technical or bribery-based. Provided that ˜O isn’t known in advance,\\nan adversary must in principle control close to a majority of O, rather than just ˜O, in\\norder to subvert r with high probability for sufficiently large n.\\nThis observation underlies many hybrid consensus protocols, e.g., [120, 182] as well\\nas some oracle protocols, e.g., [25].\\nWe believe, however, that in many applications, it will be beneficial for relying\\nparties to select stable oracle nodes (or committees), for several reasons:\\n• Non-uniform corruption: Rational nodes’ reliability is a function of incentives\\nthat reflect factors beyond their staked assets, such as potential future revenue,\\nreputation, and so forth, as discussed in Section 9. Users may prefer to rely\\non nodes they assess as being highly trustworthy, rather than randomly selected\\nnodes. Even as compared with stake-weighted randomized selection, this choice\\ncan result in selection of a more trustworthy committee, i.e., one less likely to be\\ncorrupted.\\n• Corruption thresholds: A related issue is the fact that unless n and k are quite\\nlarge or the fraction of adversarial nodes in O is quite low, the probability of a\\nrandomly selected subset ˜O having a high proportion of corrupted nodes at some\\ntime can be quite high.\\nFor example, suppose that n = 100, f = 10, i.e., only 10% of nodes are corrupted,\\nand a subcommittee of size | ˜O| = 10 is selected uniformly at random.\\nThe\\nprobability of a majority corrupt subcommittee being selected is ≈0.000009.\\nEven in a system with low throughput, handling, e.g., one request a second, if\\na new committee is selected for each job, a corrupt committee will surface on\\nexpectation in just over a day.\\nFor this reason, given adversarial fraction f/n = 1/4, with its proposed security\\nparameters, the random-committee-selection scheme in [41] requires a committee\\nsize of 26,091!\\nWe consequently believe that random selection is not sufficient to ensure the\\ntrustworthiness of O over time, an issue that is particularly pertinent given the\\nnext point we highlight.\\n• Confidentiality: In order to access data stored with oracle nodes in a threshold\\nmanner, a user must interact with the nodes that hold skL. It is possible to hand\\noffskL across committees of oracle nodes with dynamically changing member-\\nship. Apart from the potentially large increase in communication cost, frequent\\nchanges could be problematic because they result in an elevated probability of\\nthe committee having f ≥k corruptions at some time, resulting in a catastrophic\\nfailure, as explained above.\\n• Prospective bribery: As noted in Section 9, an adversary can offer a bribe to\\nnodes in a committee in advance of committee selection by making the bribe\\ncontingent on a node’s selection. That is, a node can prove that it was selected\\nand generated a desired report in order to claim a bounty. Smart contracts can\\nin fact facilitate such malfeasance using techniques like those in [165].\\n• Innovation: Oracle providers may choose to differentiate themselves based on\\nperformance, accuracy, or special features, such as enhanced confidentiality or ac-\\ncess to proprietary data. Allowing users to choose providers, rather than drawing\\nproviders from a pool with homogeneous capabilities, can help promote innova-\\ntion.\\n• Customization: Different users may have different preferences in terms of trade-\\noffs among reliability, performance, and cost tradeoffs, and should be able to\\nexpress these preferences in terms of their selection of providers.',\n",

       "  'text': 'When Satoshi Nakamoto first set the Bitcoin blockchain into motion in January 2009, he was\\nsimultaneously introducing two radical and untested concepts. The first is the \"bitcoin\", a decentralized\\npeer-to-peer online currency that maintains a value without any backing, intrinsic value or central issuer. So\\nfar, the \"bitcoin\" as a currency unit has taken up the bulk of the public attention, both in terms of the political\\naspects of a currency without a central bank and its extreme upward and downward volatility in price.\\nHowever, there is also another, equally important, part to Satoshi\\'s grand experiment: the concept of a proof of\\nwork-based blockchain to allow for public agreement on the order of transactions. Bitcoin as an application can\\nbe described as a first-to-file system: if one entity has 50 BTC, and simultaneously sends the same 50 BTC to\\nA and to B, only the transaction that gets confirmed first will process. There is no intrinsic way of determining\\nfrom two transactions which came earlier, and for decades this stymied the development of decentralized\\ndigital currency. Satoshi\\'s blockchain was the first credible decentralized solution. And now, attention is\\nrapidly starting to shift toward this second part of Bitcoin\\'s technology, and how the blockchain concept can be\\nused for more than just money.\\nCommonly cited applications include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and\\nfinancial instruments (\"colored coins\"), the ownership of an underlying physical device (\"smart property\"),\\nnon-fungible assets such as domain names (\"Namecoin\") as well as more advanced applications such as\\ndecentralized\\nexchange,\\nfinancial\\nderivatives,\\npeer-to-peer\\ngambling\\nand\\non-blockchain\\nidentity\\nand\\nreputation systems. Another important area of inquiry is \"smart contracts\" - systems which automatically\\nmove digital assets according to arbitrary pre-specified rules. For example, one might have a treasury contract\\nof the form \"A can withdraw up to X currency units per day, B can withdraw up to Y per day, A and B together\\ncan withdraw anything, and A can shut off B\\'s ability to withdraw\". The logical extension of this is\\ndecentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) - long-term smart contracts that contain the assets and\\nencode the bylaws of an entire organization. What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in\\nfully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create \"contracts\" that can be used\\nto encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as\\nwell as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.\\nethereum.org\\nEthereum:\\nA Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform.\\nBy Vitalik Buterin\\n(2014).\\nTable of contents\\n●\\nHistory\\n○\\nBitcoin As A State Transition System\\n○\\nMining\\n○\\nMerkle Trees\\n○\\nAlternative Blockchain Applications\\n○\\nScripting\\n●\\nEthereum\\n○\\nEthereum Accounts\\n○\\nMessages and Transactions\\n○\\nEthereum State Transition Function\\n○\\nCode Execution\\n○\\nBlockchain and Mining\\n●\\nApplications\\n○\\nToken Systems\\n○\\nFinancial derivatives\\n○\\nIdentity and Reputation Systems\\n○\\nDecentralized File Storage\\n○\\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations\\n○\\nFurther Applications\\n●\\nMiscellanea And Concerns\\n○\\nModified GHOST Implementation\\n○\\nFees\\n○\\nComputation And Turing-Completeness\\n○\\nCurrency And Issuance\\n○\\nMining Centralization\\n○\\nScalability\\n●\\nPutting It All Together: Decentralized Applications\\n●\\nConclusion\\n●\\nReferences and Further Reading\\nethereum.org\\nethereum.org\\nHistory\\nThe concept of decentralized digital currency, as well as alternative applications like property registries,\\nhas been around for decades. The anonymous e-cash protocols of the 1980s and the 1990s, mostly\\nreliant on a cryptographic primitive known as Chaumian blinding, provided a currency with a high degree\\nof privacy, but the protocols largely failed to gain traction because of their reliance on a centralized\\nintermediary. In 1998, Wei Dai\\'s b-money became the first proposal to introduce the idea of creating\\nmoney through solving computational puzzles as well as decentralized consensus, but the proposal\\nwas scant on details as to how decentralized consensus could actually be implemented. In 2005, Hal\\nFinney introduced a concept of \"reusable proofs of work\", a system which uses ideas from b-money\\ntogether with Adam Back\\'s computationally difficult Hashcash puzzles to create a concept for a\\ncryptocurrency, but once again fell short of the ideal by relying on trusted computing as a backend.\\nBecause currency is a first-to-file application, where the order of transactions is often of critical\\nimportance, decentralized currencies require a solution to decentralized consensus. The main roadblock\\nthat all pre-Bitcoin currency protocols faced is the fact that, while there had been plenty of research on\\ncreating secure Byzantine-fault-tolerant multiparty consensus systems for many years, all of the\\nprotocols described were solving only half of the problem. The protocols assumed that all participants in\\nthe system were known, and produced security margins of the form \"if N parties participate, then the\\nsystem can tolerate up to N/4 malicious actors\". The problem is, however, that in an anonymous setting\\nsuch security margins are vulnerable to sybil attacks, where a single attacker creates thousands of\\nsimulated nodes on a server or botnet and uses these nodes to unilaterally secure a majority share.\\nThe innovation provided by Satoshi is the idea of combining a very simple decentralized consensus\\nprotocol, based on nodes combining transactions into a \"block\" every ten minutes creating an\\never-growing blockchain, with proof of work as a mechanism through which nodes gain the right to\\nparticipate in the system. While nodes with a large amount of computational power do have\\nproportionately greater influence, coming up with more computational power than the entire network\\ncombined is much harder than simulating a million nodes. Despite the Bitcoin blockchain model\\'s\\ncrudeness and simplicity, it has proven to be good enough, and would over the next five years become\\nthe bedrock of over two hundred currencies and protocols around the world.\\nethereum.org\\nBitcoin As A State Transition System\\nFrom a technical standpoint, the Bitcoin ledger can be thought of as a state transition system, where there is\\na \"state\" consisting of the ownership status of all existing bitcoins and a \"state transition function\" that takes\\na state and a transaction and outputs a new state which is the result. In a standard banking system, for\\nexample, the state is a balance sheet, a transaction is a request to move $X from A to B, and the state\\ntransition function reduces the value in A\\'s account by $X and increases the value in B\\'s account by $X. If A\\'s\\naccount has less than $X in the first place, the state transition function returns an error. Hence, one can\\nformally define:\\nAPPLY(S,TX)\\xa0>\\xa0S\\'\\xa0or\\xa0ERROR\\nIn the banking system defined above:\\nAPPLY({ Alice: $50, Bob: $50 },\"send $20 from Alice to Bob\") = { Alice: $30,\\nBob:\\xa0$70\\xa0}\\nBut:\\nAPPLY({\\xa0Alice:\\xa0$50,\\xa0Bob:\\xa0$50\\xa0},\"send\\xa0$70\\xa0from\\xa0Alice\\xa0to\\xa0Bob\")\\xa0=\\xa0ERROR\\xa0\\nThe \"state\" in Bitcoin is the collection of all coins (technically, \"unspent transaction outputs\" or UTXO) that\\nhave been minted and not yet spent, with each UTXO having a denomination and an owner (defined by a\\n20-byte address which is essentially a cryptographic public key[1]). A transaction contains one or more inputs,\\nwith each input containing a reference to an existing UTXO and a cryptographic signature produced by the\\nprivate key associated with the owner\\'s address, and one or more outputs, with each output containing a new\\nUTXO to be added to the state.\\nethereum.org\\nThe state transition function APPLY(S,TX)\\xa0>\\xa0S\\'\\xa0can be defined roughly as follows:\\n1.\\nFor each input in TX:\\ni.\\nIf the referenced UTXO is not in S, return an error.\\nii.\\nIf the provided signature does not match the owner of the UTXO, return an error.\\n2.\\nIf the sum of the denominations of all input UTXO is less than the sum of the denominations of\\nall output UTXO, return an error.\\n3.\\nReturn S with all input UTXO removed and all output UTXO added.\\nThe first half of the first step prevents transaction senders from spending coins that do not exist, the second\\nhalf of the first step prevents transaction senders from spending other people\\'s coins, and the second step\\nenforces conservation of value. In order to use this for payment, the protocol is as follows. Suppose Alice wants\\nto send 11.7 BTC to Bob. First, Alice will look for a set of available UTXO that she owns that totals up to at least\\n11.7 BTC. Realistically, Alice will not be able to get exactly 11.7 BTC; say that the smallest she can get is\\n6+4+2=12. She then creates a transaction with those three inputs and two outputs. The first output will be 11.7\\nBTC with Bob\\'s address as its owner, and the second output will be the remaining 0.3 BTC \"change\", with the\\nowner being Alice herself.\\nMining\\nIf we had access to a trustworthy centralized service, this system would be trivial to implement; it\\ncould simply be coded exactly as described. However, with Bitcoin we are trying to build a\\ndecentralized currency system, so we will need to combine the state transition system with a\\nconsensus system in order to ensure that everyone agrees on the order of transactions. Bitcoin\\'s\\ndecentralized consensus process requires nodes in the network to continuously attempt to produce\\npackages of transactions called \"blocks\". The network is intended to produce roughly one block every\\nten minutes, with each block containing a timestamp, a nonce, a reference to (ie. hash of) the\\nethereum.org\\nprevious block and a list of all of the transactions that have taken place since the previous block.\\nOver time, this creates a persistent, ever-growing, \"blockchain\" that constantly updates to represent\\nthe latest state of the Bitcoin ledger.\\nThe algorithm for checking if a block is valid, expressed in this paradigm, is as follows:\\n1.\\nCheck if the previous block referenced by the block exists and is valid\\n2.\\nCheck that the timestamp of the block is greater than that of the previous block[2] and less than 2\\nhours into the future.\\n3.\\nCheck that the proof of work on the block is valid.\\n4.\\nLet S[0] be the state at the end of the previous block.\\n5.\\nSuppose TX is the block\\'s transaction list with n transactions. For all i in 0...n-1, setS[i+1] =\\nAPPLY(S[i],TX[i]) If any application returns an error, exit and return false.\\n6.\\nReturn true, and register S[n] as the state at the end of this block\\nEssentially, each transaction in the block must provide a state transition that is valid. Note that the state is\\nnot encoded in the block in any way; it is purely an abstraction to be remembered by the validating node and\\ncan only be (securely) computed for any block by starting from the genesis state and sequentially applying\\nevery transaction in every block. Additionally, note that the order in which the miner includes transactions into\\nthe block matters; if there are two transactions A and B in a block such that B spends a UTXO created by A,\\nthen the block will be valid if A comes before B but not otherwise.\\nThe interesting part of the block validation algorithm is the concept of \"proof of work\": the condition is that the\\nSHA256 hash of every block, treated as a 256-bit number, must be less than a dynamically adjusted target,\\nwhich as of the time of this writing is approximately 2190. The purpose of this is to make block creation\\ncomputationally \"hard\", thereby preventing sybil attackers from remaking the entire blockchain in their favor.\\nBecause SHA256 is designed to be a completely unpredictable pseudorandom function, the only way to create\\na valid block is simply trial and error, repeatedly incrementing the nonce and seeing if the new hash matches.\\nAt the current target of 2192, this means an average of 264 tries; in general, the target is recalibrated by the\\nnetwork every 2016 blocks so that on average a new block is produced by some node in the network every ten\\nminutes. In order to compensate miners for this computational work, the miner of every block is entitled to\\ninclude a transaction giving themselves 25 BTC out of nowhere. Additionally, if any transaction has a higher\\ntotal denomination in its inputs than in its outputs, the difference also goes to the miner as a \"transaction\\nfee\". Incidentally, this is also the only mechanism by which BTC are issued; the genesis state contained no\\ncoins at all.\\nethereum.org\\nIn order to better understand the purpose of mining, let us examine what happens in the event of a malicious\\nattacker. Since Bitcoin\\'s underlying cryptography is known to be secure, the attacker will target the one part of\\nthe Bitcoin system that is not protected by cryptography directly: the order of transactions. The attacker\\'s\\nstrategy is simple:\\n1.\\nSend 100 BTC to a merchant in exchange for some product (preferably a rapid-delivery digital\\ngood)\\n2.\\nWait for the delivery of the product\\n3.\\nProduce another transaction sending the same 100 BTC to himself\\n4.\\nTry to convince the network that his transaction to himself was the one that came first.\\nOnce step (1) has taken place, after a few minutes some miner will include the transaction in a block, say\\nblock number 270000. After about one hour, five more blocks will have been added to the chain after that block,\\nwith each of those blocks indirectly pointing to the transaction and thus \"confirming\" it. At this point, the\\nmerchant will accept the payment as finalized and deliver the product; since we are assuming this is a digital\\ngood, delivery is instant. Now, the attacker creates another transaction sending the 100 BTC to himself. If the\\nattacker simply releases it into the wild, the transaction will not be processed; miners will attempt to run\\nAPPLY(S,TX) and notice that TX consumes a UTXO which is no longer in the state. So instead, the attacker\\ncreates a \"fork\" of the blockchain, starting by mining another version of block 270000 pointing to the same\\nblock 269999 as a parent but with the new transaction in place of the old one. Because the block data is\\ndifferent, this requires redoing the proof of work. Furthermore, the attacker\\'s new version of block 270000 has a\\ndifferent hash, so the original blocks 270001 to 270005 do not \"point\" to it; thus, the original chain and the\\nattacker\\'s new chain are completely separate. The rule is that in a fork the longest blockchain (ie. the one\\nbacked by the largest quantity of proof of work) is taken to be the truth, and so legitimate miners will work on\\nthe 270005 chain while the attacker alone is working on the 270000 chain. In order for the attacker to make\\nhis blockchain the longest, he would need to have more computational power than the rest of the network\\ncombined in order to catch up (hence, \"51% attack\").\\nethereum.org\\nMerkle Trees\\nLeft: it suffices to present only a small number of nodes in a Merkle tree to give a proof of the validity of a branch.\\nRight: any attempt to change any part of the Merkle tree will eventually lead to an inconsistency somewhere up the\\nchain.\\nAn important scalability feature of Bitcoin is that the block is stored in a multi-level data structure. The \"hash\"\\nof a block is actually only the hash of the block header, a roughly 200-byte piece of data that contains the\\ntimestamp, nonce, previous block hash and the root hash of a data structure called the Merkle tree storing all\\ntransactions in the block.\\nA Merkle tree is a type of binary tree, composed of a set of nodes with a large number of leaf nodes at the\\nbottom of the tree containing the underlying data, a set of intermediate nodes where each node is the hash of\\nits two children, and finally a single root node, also formed from the hash of its two children, representing the\\n\"top\" of the tree. The purpose of the Merkle tree is to allow the data in a block to be delivered piecemeal: a node\\ncan download only the header of a block from one source, the small part of the tree relevant to them from\\nethereum.org\\nanother source, and still be assured that all of the data is correct. The reason why this works is that hashes\\npropagate upward: if a malicious user attempts to swap in a fake transaction into the bottom of a Merkle tree,\\nthis change will cause a change in the node above, and then a change in the node above that, finally\\nchanging the root of the tree and therefore the hash of the block, causing the protocol to register it as a\\ncompletely different block (almost certainly with an invalid proof of work).\\nThe Merkle tree protocol is arguably essential to long-term sustainability. A \"full node\" in the Bitcoin network,\\none that stores and processes the entirety of every block, takes up about 15 GB of disk space in the Bitcoin\\nnetwork as of April 2014, and is growing by over a gigabyte per month. Currently, this is viable for some desktop\\ncomputers and not phones, and later on in the future only businesses and hobbyists will be able to participate.\\nA protocol known as \"simplified payment verification\" (SPV) allows for another class of nodes to exist, called\\n\"light nodes\", which download the block headers, verify the proof of work on the block headers, and then\\ndownload only the \"branches\" associated with transactions that are relevant to them. This allows light nodes\\nto determine with a strong guarantee of security what the status of any Bitcoin transaction, and their current\\nbalance, is while downloading only a very small portion of the entire blockchain.\\nAlternative Blockchain Applications\\nThe idea of taking the underlying blockchain idea and applying it to other concepts also has a long history. In\\n2005, Nick Szabo came out with the concept of \"secure property titles with owner authority\", a document\\ndescribing how \"new advances in replicated database technology\" will allow for a blockchain-based system for\\nstoring a registry of who owns what land, creating an elaborate framework including concepts such as\\nhomesteading, adverse possession and Georgian land tax. However, there was unfortunately no effective\\nreplicated database system available at the time, and so the protocol was never implemented in practice.\\nAfter 2009, however, once Bitcoin\\'s decentralized consensus was developed a number of alternative\\napplications rapidly began to emerge:\\n●\\nNamecoin - created in 2010, Namecoin is best described as a decentralized name registration\\ndatabase. In decentralized protocols like Tor, Bitcoin and BitMessage, there needs to be some way\\nof identifying accounts so that other people can interact with them, but in all existing solutions the\\nonly\\nkind\\nof\\nidentifier\\navailable\\nis\\na\\npseudorandom\\nhash\\nlike1LW79wp5ZBqaHW1jL5TCiBCrhQYtHagUWy. Ideally, one would like to be able to have an\\naccount with a name like \"george\". However, the problem is that if one person can create an\\naccount named \"george\" then someone else can use the same process to register \"george\" for\\nthemselves as well and impersonate them. The only solution is a first-to-file paradigm, where the\\nfirst registrant succeeds and the second fails - a problem perfectly suited for the Bitcoin consensus\\nprotocol. Namecoin is the oldest, and most successful, implementation of a name registration\\nsystem using such an idea.\\n●\\nColored coins - the purpose of colored coins is to serve as a protocol to allow people to create their\\nown digital currencies - or, in the important trivial case of a currency with one unit, digital tokens,\\nethereum.org\\non the Bitcoin blockchain. In the colored coins protocol, one \"issues\" a new currency by publicly\\nassigning a color to a specific Bitcoin UTXO, and the protocol recursively defines the color of other\\nUTXO to be the same as the color of the inputs that the transaction creating them spent (some\\nspecial rules apply in the case of mixed-color inputs). This allows users to maintain wallets\\ncontaining only UTXO of a specific color and send them around much like regular bitcoins,\\nbacktracking through the blockchain to determine the color of any UTXO that they receive.\\n●\\nMetacoins - the idea behind a metacoin is to have a protocol that lives on top of Bitcoin, using\\nBitcoin transactions to store metacoin transactions but having a different state transition function,\\nAPPLY\\'. Because the metacoin protocol cannot prevent invalid metacoin transactions from\\nappearing in the Bitcoin blockchain, a rule is added that if APPLY\\'(S,TX) returns an error, the\\nprotocol defaults to APPLY\\'(S,TX) = S. This provides an easy mechanism for creating an arbitrary\\ncryptocurrency protocol, potentially with advanced features that cannot be implemented inside of\\nBitcoin itself, but with a very low development cost since the complexities of mining and networking\\nare already handled by the Bitcoin protocol.\\nThus, in general, there are two approaches toward building a consensus protocol: building an independent\\nnetwork, and building a protocol on top of Bitcoin. The former approach, while reasonably successful in the\\ncase of applications like Namecoin, is difficult to implement; each individual implementation needs to\\nbootstrap an independent blockchain, as well as building and testing all of the necessary state transition and\\nnetworking code. Additionally, we predict that the set of applications for decentralized consensus technology\\nwill follow a power law distribution where the vast majority of applications would be too small to warrant their\\nown blockchain, and we note that there exist large classes of decentralized applications, particularly\\ndecentralized autonomous organizations, that need to interact with each other.\\nThe Bitcoin-based approach, on the other hand, has the flaw that it does not inherit the simplified payment\\nverification features of Bitcoin. SPV works for Bitcoin because it can use blockchain depth as a proxy for\\nvalidity; at some point, once the ancestors of a transaction go far enough back, it is safe to say that they were\\nlegitimately part of the state. Blockchain-based meta-protocols, on the other hand, cannot force the blockchain\\nnot to include transactions that are not valid within the context of their own protocols. Hence, a fully secure\\nSPV meta-protocol implementation would need to backward scan all the way to the beginning of the Bitcoin\\nblockchain to determine whether or not certain transactions are valid. Currently, all \"light\" implementations of\\nBitcoin-based meta-protocols rely on a trusted server to provide the data, arguably a highly suboptimal result\\nespecially when one of the primary purposes of a cryptocurrency is to eliminate the need for trust.\\nScripting\\nEven without any extensions, the Bitcoin protocol actually does facilitate a weak version of a concept of \"smart\\ncontracts\". UTXO in Bitcoin can be owned not just by a public key, but also by a more complicated script\\nexpressed in a simple stack-based programming language. In this paradigm, a transaction spending that\\nUTXO must provide data that satisfies the script. Indeed, even the basic public key ownership mechanism is\\nethereum.org\\nimplemented via a script: the script takes an elliptic curve signature as input, verifies it against the\\ntransaction and the address that owns the UTXO, and returns 1 if the verification is successful and 0\\notherwise. Other, more complicated, scripts exist for various additional use cases. For example, one can\\nconstruct a script that requires signatures from two out of a given three private keys to validate (\"multisig\"), a\\nsetup useful for corporate accounts, secure savings accounts and some merchant escrow situations. Scripts\\ncan also be used to pay bounties for solutions to computational problems, and one can even construct a script\\nthat says something like \"this Bitcoin UTXO is yours if you can provide an SPV proof that you sent a Dogecoin\\ntransaction of this denomination to me\", essentially allowing decentralized cross-cryptocurrency exchange.\\nHowever, the scripting language as implemented in Bitcoin has several important limitations:\\n●\\nLack of Turing-completeness - that is to say, while there is a large subset of computation\\nthat the Bitcoin scripting language supports, it does not nearly support everything. The main\\ncategory that is missing is loops. This is done to avoid infinite loops during transaction verification;\\ntheoretically it is a surmountable obstacle for script programmers, since any loop can be simulated\\nby simply repeating the underlying code many times with an if statement, but it does lead to scripts\\nthat are very space-inefficient. For example, implementing an alternative elliptic curve signature\\nalgorithm would likely require 256 repeated multiplication rounds all individually included in the\\ncode.\\n●\\nValue-blindness - there is no way for a UTXO script to provide fine-grained control over the\\namount that can be withdrawn. For example, one powerful use case of an oracle contract would be a\\nhedging contract, where A and B put in $1000 worth of BTC and after 30 days the script sends $1000\\nworth of BTC to A and the rest to B. This would require an oracle to determine the value of 1 BTC in\\nUSD, but even then it is a massive improvement in terms of trust and infrastructure requirement over\\nthe fully centralized solutions that are available now. However, because UTXO are all-or-nothing, the\\nonly way to achieve this is through the very inefficient hack of having many UTXO of varying\\ndenominations (eg. one UTXO of 2k for every k up to 30) and having the oracle pick which UTXO to\\nsend to A and which to B.\\n●\\nLack of state - UTXO can either be spent or unspent; there is no opportunity for multi-stage\\ncontracts or scripts which keep any other internal state beyond that. This makes it hard to make\\nmulti-stage options contracts, decentralized exchange offers or two-stage cryptographic commitment\\nprotocols (necessary for secure computational bounties). It also means that UTXO can only be used\\nto build simple, one-off contracts and not more complex \"stateful\" contracts such as decentralized\\norganizations, and makes meta-protocols difficult to implement. Binary state combined with\\nvalue-blindness also mean that another important application, withdrawal limits, is impossible.\\n●\\nBlockchain-blindness - UTXO are blind to blockchain data such as the nonce and previous\\nhash. This severely limits applications in gambling, and several other categories, by depriving the\\nscripting language of a potentially valuable source of randomness.\\nethereum.org\\nThus, we see three approaches to building advanced applications on top of cryptocurrency: building a new\\nblockchain, using scripting on top of Bitcoin, and building a meta-protocol on top of Bitcoin. Building a new\\nblockchain allows for unlimited freedom in building a feature set, but at the cost of development time and\\nbootstrapping effort. Using scripting is easy to implement and standardize, but is very limited in its\\ncapabilities, and meta-protocols, while easy, suffer from faults in scalability. With Ethereum, we intend to build\\na generalized framework that can provide the advantages of all three paradigms at the same time.\\nEthereum\\nThe intent of Ethereum is to merge together and improve upon the concepts of scripting, altcoins and on-chain\\nmeta-protocols, and allow developers to create arbitrary consensus-based applications that have the\\nscalability, standardization, feature-completeness, ease of development and interoperability offered by these\\ndifferent paradigms all at the same time. Ethereum does this by building what is essentially the ultimate\\nabstract foundational layer: a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing\\nanyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary\\nrules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions. A bare-bones version of Namecoin can\\nbe written in two lines of code, and other protocols like currencies and reputation systems can be built in under\\ntwenty. Smart contracts, cryptographic \"boxes\" that contain value and only unlock it if certain conditions are\\nmet, can also be built on top of our platform, with vastly more power than that offered by Bitcoin scripting\\nbecause of the added powers of Turing-completeness, value-awareness, blockchain-awareness and state.\\nEthereum Accounts\\nIn Ethereum, the state is made up of objects called \"accounts\", with each account having a 20-byte address\\nand state transitions being direct transfers of value and information between accounts. An Ethereum account\\ncontains four fields:\\n●\\nThe nonce, a counter used to make sure each transaction can only be processed once\\n●\\nThe account\\'s current ether balance\\n●\\nThe account\\'s contract code, if present\\n●\\nThe account\\'s storage (empty by default)\\n\"Ether\" is the main internal crypto-fuel of Ethereum, and is used to pay transaction fees. In general, there are\\ntwo types of accounts: externally owned accounts, controlled by private keys, and contract accounts, controlled\\nby their contract code. An externally owned account has no code, and one can send messages from an\\nexternally owned account by creating and signing a transaction; in a contract account, every time the\\nethereum.org\\ncontract account receives a message its code activates, allowing it to read and write to internal storage and\\nsend other messages or create contracts in turn.\\nMessages and Transactions\\n\"Messages\" in Ethereum are somewhat similar to “transactions” in Bitcoin, but with three important\\ndifferences. First, an Ethereum message can be created either by an external entity or a contract, whereas a\\nBitcoin transaction can only be created externally. Second, there is an explicit option for Ethereum messages\\nto contain data. Finally, the recipient of an Ethereum message, if it is a contract account, has the option to\\nreturn a response; this means that Ethereum messages also encompass the concept of functions.\\nThe term \"transaction\" is used in Ethereum to refer to the signed data package that stores a message to be\\nsent from an externally owned account. Transactions contain the recipient of the message, a signature\\nidentifying the sender, the amount of ether and the data to send, as well as two values called STARTGAS and\\nGASPRICE. In order to prevent exponential blowup and infinite loops in code, each transaction is required to set\\na limit to how many computational steps of code execution it can spawn, including both the initial message\\nand any additional messages that get spawned during execution. STARTGAS is this limit, and GASPRICE is\\nthe fee to pay to the miner per computational step. If transaction execution \"runs out of gas\", all state changes\\nrevert - except for the payment of the fees, and if transaction execution halts with some gas remaining then\\nthe remaining portion of the fees is refunded to the sender. There is also a separate transaction type, and\\ncorresponding message type, for creating a contract; the address of a contract is calculated based on the\\nhash of the account nonce and transaction data.\\nAn important consequence of the message mechanism is the \"first class citizen\" property of Ethereum - the\\nidea that contracts have equivalent powers to external accounts, including the ability to send message and\\ncreate other contracts. This allows contracts to simultaneously serve many different roles: for example, one\\nmight have a member of a decentralized organization (a contract) be an escrow account (another contract)\\nbetween an paranoid individual employing custom quantum-proof Lamport signatures (a third contract) and\\na co-signing entity which itself uses an account with five keys for security (a fourth contract). The strength of\\nthe Ethereum platform is that the decentralized organization and the escrow contract do not need to care\\nabout what kind of account each party to the contract is.\\nethereum.org\\nEthereum State Transition Function\\nThe Ethereum state transition function, APPLY(S,TX) -> S\\' can be defined as follows:\\n1.\\nCheck if the transaction is well-formed (ie. has the right number of values), the signature is valid,\\nand the nonce matches the nonce in the sender\\'s account. If not, return an error.\\n2.\\nCalculate the transaction fee as STARTGAS * GASPRICE, and determine the sending address from\\nthe signature. Subtract the fee from the sender\\'s account balance and increment the sender\\'s\\nnonce. If there is not enough balance to spend, return an error.\\n3.\\nInitialize GAS = STARTGAS, and take off a certain quantity of gas per byte to pay for the bytes in\\nthe transaction.\\n4.\\nTransfer the transaction value from the sender\\'s account to the receiving account. If the receiving\\naccount does not yet exist, create it. If the receiving account is a contract, run the contract\\'s code\\neither to completion or until the execution runs out of gas.\\n5.\\nIf the value transfer failed because the sender did not have enough money, or the code execution\\nran out of gas, revert all state changes except the payment of the fees, and add the fees to the\\nminer\\'s account.\\n6.\\nOtherwise, refund the fees for all remaining gas to the sender, and send the fees paid for gas\\nconsumed to the miner.\\nethereum.org\\nFor example, suppose that the contract\\'s code is:\\nif !contract.storage[msg.data[0]]:\\ncontract.storage[msg.data[0]] = msg.data[1]\\nNote that in reality the contract code is written in the low-level EVM code; this example is written in Serpent,\\nour high-level language, for clarity, and can be compiled down to EVM code. Suppose that the contract\\'s\\nstorage starts off empty, and a transaction is sent with 10 ether value, 2000 gas, 0.001 ether gasprice, and\\ntwo data fields: [ 2, \\'CHARLIE\\' ][3]. The process for the state transition function in this case is as follows:\\n1.\\nCheck that the transaction is valid and well formed.\\n2.\\nCheck that the transaction sender has at least 2000 * 0.001 = 2 ether. If it is, then subtract 2 ether\\nfrom the sender\\'s account.\\n3.\\nInitialize gas = 2000; assuming the transaction is 170 bytes long and the byte-fee is 5, subtract\\n850 so that there is 1150 gas left.\\n4.\\nSubtract 10 more ether from the sender\\'s account, and add it to the contract\\'s account.\\n5.\\nRun the code. In this case, this is simple: it checks if the contract\\'s storage at index 2 is used,\\nnotices that it is not, and so it sets the storage at index 2 to the value CHARLIE. Suppose this takes\\n187 gas, so the remaining amount of gas is 1150 - 187 = 963\\n6.\\nAdd 963 * 0.001 = 0.963 ether back to the sender\\'s account, and return the resulting state.\\nIf there was no contract at the receiving end of the transaction, then the total transaction fee would simply be\\nequal to the provided GASPRICE multiplied by the length of the transaction in bytes, and the data sent\\nalongside the transaction would be irrelevant. Additionally, note that contract-initiated messages can assign\\na gas limit to the computation that they spawn, and if the sub-computation runs out of gas it gets reverted\\nonly to the point of the message call. Hence, just like transactions, contracts can secure their limited\\ncomputational resources by setting strict limits on the sub-computations that they spawn.\\nethereum.org\\nCode Execution\\nThe code in Ethereum contracts is written in a low-level, stack-based bytecode language, referred to as\\n\"Ethereum virtual machine code\" or \"EVM code\". The code consists of a series of bytes, where each byte\\nrepresents an operation. In general, code execution is an infinite loop that consists of repeatedly carrying out\\nthe operation at the current program counter (which begins at zero) and then incrementing the program\\ncounter by one, until the end of the code is reached or an error or STOP or RETURN instruction is detected. The\\noperations have access to three types of space in which to store data:\\n●\\nThe stack, a last-in-first-out container to which 32-byte values can be pushed and popped\\n●\\nMemory, an infinitely expandable byte array\\n●\\nThe contract\\'s long-term storage, a key/value store where keys and values are both 32\\nbytes. Unlike stack and memory, which reset after computation ends, storage persists for the long\\nterm.\\nThe code can also access the value, sender and data of the incoming message, as well as block header data,\\nand the code can also return a byte array of data as an output.\\nThe formal execution model of EVM code is surprisingly simple. While the Ethereum virtual machine is\\nrunning, its full computational state can be defined by the tuple (block_state, transaction, message, code,\\nmemory, stack, pc, gas), where block_state is the global state containing all accounts and includes balances\\nand storage. Every round of execution, the current instruction is found by taking the pc-th byte of code, and\\neach instruction has its own definition in terms of how it affects the tuple. For example, ADD pops two items off\\nthe stack and pushes their sum, reduces gas by 1 and increments pc by 1, and SSTORE pushes the top two\\nitems off the stack and inserts the second item into the contract\\'s storage at the index specified by the first\\nitem, as well as reducing gas by up to 200 and incrementing pc by 1. Although there are many ways to\\noptimize Ethereum via just-in-time compilation, a basic implementation of Ethereum can be done in a few\\nhundred lines of code.\\nethereum.org\\nBlockchain and Mining\\nThe Ethereum blockchain is in many ways similar to the Bitcoin blockchain, although it does have some\\ndifferences. The main difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin with regard to the blockchain architecture is\\nthat, unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum blocks contain a copy of both the transaction list and the most recent state.\\nAside from that, two other values, the block number and the difficulty, are also stored in the block. The block\\nvalidation algorithm in Ethereum is as follows:\\n1.\\nCheck if the previous block referenced exists and is valid.\\n2.\\nCheck that the timestamp of the block is greater than that of the referenced previous block and\\nless than 15 minutes into the future\\n3.\\nCheck that the block number, difficulty, transaction root, uncle root and gas limit (various low-level\\nEthereum-specific concepts) are valid.\\n4.\\nCheck that the proof of work on the block is valid.\\n5.\\nLet S[0] be the STATE_ROOT of the previous block.\\n6.\\nLet TX be the block\\'s transaction list, with n transactions. For all in in 0...n-1, setS[i+1] =\\nAPPLY(S[i],TX[i]). If any applications returns an error, or if the total gas consumed in the block up\\nuntil this point exceeds the GASLIMIT, return an error.\\n7.\\nLet S_FINAL be S[n], but adding the block reward paid to the miner.\\n8.\\nCheck if S_FINAL is the same as the STATE_ROOT. If it is, the block is valid; otherwise, it is not valid.\\nethereum.org\\nThe approach may seem highly inefficient at first glance, because it needs to store the entire state with each\\nblock, but in reality efficiency should be comparable to that of Bitcoin. The reason is that the state is stored in\\nthe tree structure, and after every block only a small part of the tree needs to be changed. Thus, in general,\\nbetween two adjacent blocks the vast majority of the tree should be the same, and therefore the data can be\\nstored once and referenced twice using pointers (ie. hashes of subtrees). A special kind of tree known as a\\n\"Patricia tree\" is used to accomplish this, including a modification to the Merkle tree concept that allows for\\nnodes to be inserted and deleted, and not just changed, efficiently. Additionally, because all of the state\\ninformation is part of the last block, there is no need to store the entire blockchain history - a strategy which, if\\nit could be applied to Bitcoin, can be calculated to provide 5-20x savings in space.\\nApplications\\nIn general, there are three types of applications on top of Ethereum. The first category is financial applications,\\nproviding users with more powerful ways of managing and entering into contracts using their money. This\\nincludes sub-currencies, financial derivatives, hedging contracts, savings wallets, wills, and ultimately even\\nsome classes of full-scale employment contracts. The second category is semi-financial applications, where\\nmoney is involved but there is also a heavy non-monetary side to what is being done; a perfect example is\\nself-enforcing bounties for solutions to computational problems. Finally, there are applications such as online\\nvoting and decentralized governance that are not financial at all.\\nToken Systems\\nOn-blockchain token systems have many applications ranging from sub-currencies representing assets such\\nas USD or gold to company stocks, individual tokens representing smart property, secure unforgeable coupons,\\nand even token systems with no ties to conventional value at all, used as point systems for incentivization.\\nToken systems are surprisingly easy to implement in Ethereum. The key point to understand is that all a\\ncurrency, or token systen, fundamentally is is a database with one operation: subtract X units from A and give\\nX units to B, with the proviso that (i) X had at least X units before the transaction and (2) the transaction is\\napproved by A. All that it takes to implement a token system is to implement this logic into a contract.\\nethereum.org\\nThe basic code for implementing a token system in Serpent looks as follows:\\nfrom\\xa0=\\xa0msg.sender\\xa0\\nto\\xa0=\\xa0msg.data[0]\\xa0\\nvalue\\xa0=\\xa0msg.data[1]\\xa0\\nif\\xa0contract.storage[from]\\xa0>=\\xa0value:\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0contract.storage[from]\\xa0=\\xa0contract.storage[from]\\xa0\\xa0value\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0contract.storage[to]\\xa0=\\xa0contract.storage[to]\\xa0+\\xa0value\\xa0\\nThis is essentially a literal implementation of the \"banking system\" state transition function described further\\nabove in this document. A few extra lines of code need to be added to provide for the initial step of distributing\\nthe currency units in the first place and a few other edge cases, and ideally a function would be added to let\\nother contracts query for the balance of an address. But that\\'s all there is to it. Theoretically, Ethereum-based\\ntoken systems acting as sub-currencies can potentially include another important feature that on-chain\\nBitcoin-based meta-currencies lack: the ability to pay transaction fees directly in that currency. The way this\\nwould be implemented is that the contract would maintain an ether balance with which it would refund ether\\nused to pay fees to the sender, and it would refill this balance by collecting the internal currency units that it\\ntakes in fees and reselling them in a constant running auction. Users would thus need to \"activate\" their\\naccounts with ether, but once the ether is there it would be reusable because the contract would refund it each\\ntime.\\nFinancial derivatives and Stable-Value Currencies\\nFinancial derivatives are the most common application of a \"smart contract\", and one of the simplest to\\nimplement in code. The main challenge in implementing financial contracts is that the majority of them\\nrequire reference to an external price ticker; for example, a very desirable application is a smart contract that\\nhedges against the volatility of ether (or another cryptocurrency) with respect to the US dollar, but doing this\\nrequires the contract to know what the value of ETH/USD is. The simplest way to do this is through a \"data\\nfeed\" contract maintained by a specific party (eg. NASDAQ) designed so that that party has the ability to\\nupdate the contract as needed, and providing an interface that allows other contracts to send a message to\\nthat contract and get back a response that provides the price.\\nGiven that critical ingredient, the hedging contract would look as follows:\\n1.\\nWait for party A to input 1000 ether.\\n2.\\nWait for party B to input 1000 ether.\\n3.\\nRecord the USD value of 1000 ether, calculated by querying the data feed contract, in storage, say this\\nis $x.\\n4.\\nAfter 30 days, allow A or B to \"ping\" the contract in order to send $x worth of ether (calculated by\\nquerying the data feed contract again to get the new price) to A and the rest to B.\\nethereum.org\\nSuch a contract would have significant potential in crypto-commerce. One of the main problems cited about\\ncryptocurrency is the fact that it\\'s volatile; although many users and merchants may want the security and\\nconvenience of dealing with cryptographic assets, they many not wish to face that prospect of losing 23% of\\nthe value of their funds in a single day. Up until now, the most commonly proposed solution has been\\nissuer-backed assets; the idea is that an issuer creates a sub-currency in which they have the right to issue\\nand revoke units, and provide one unit of the currency to anyone who provides them (offline) with one unit of a\\nspecified underlying asset (eg. gold, USD). The issuer then promises to provide one unit of the underlying\\nasset to anyone who sends back one unit of the crypto-asset. This mechanism allows any non-cryptographic\\nasset to be \"uplifted\" into a cryptographic asset, provided that the issuer can be trusted.\\nIn practice, however, issuers are not always trustworthy, and in some cases the banking infrastructure is too\\nweak, or too hostile, for such services to exist. Financial derivatives provide an alternative. Here, instead of a\\nsingle issuer providing the funds to back up an asset, a decentralized market of speculators, betting that the\\nprice of a cryptographic reference asset will go up, plays that role. Unlike issuers, speculators have no option to\\ndefault on their side of the bargain because the hedging contract holds their funds in escrow. Note that this\\napproach is not fully decentralized, because a trusted source is still needed to provide the price ticker,\\nalthough arguably even still this is a massive improvement in terms of reducing infrastructure requirements\\n(unlike being an issuer, issuing a price feed requires no licenses and can likely be categorized as free speech)\\nand reducing the potential for fraud.\\nethereum.org\\nIdentity and Reputation Systems\\nThe earliest alternative cryptocurrency of all, Namecoin, attempted to use a Bitcoin-like blockchain to provide a\\nname registration system, where users can register their names in a public database alongside other data.\\nThe major cited use case is for a DNS system, mapping domain names like \"bitcoin.org\" (or, in Namecoin\\'s\\ncase, \"bitcoin.bit\") to an IP address. Other use cases include email authentication and potentially more\\nadvanced reputation systems. Here is the basic contract to provide a Namecoin-like name registration system\\non Ethereum:\\nif\\xa0!contract.storage[tx.data[0]]:\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0contract.storage[tx.data[0]]\\xa0=\\xa0tx.data[1]\\nThe contract is very simple; all it is is a database inside the Ethereum network that can be added to, but not\\nmodified or removed from. Anyone can register a name with some value, and that registration then sticks\\nforever. A more sophisticated name registration contract will also have a \"function clause\" allowing other\\ncontracts to query it, as well as a mechanism for the \"owner\" (ie. the first registerer) of a name to change the\\ndata or transfer ownership. One can even add reputation and web-of-trust functionality on top.\\nDecentralized File Storage\\nOver the past few years, there have emerged a number of popular online file storage startups, the most\\nprominent being Dropbox, seeking to allow users to upload a backup of their hard drive and have the service\\nstore the backup and allow the user to access it in exchange for a monthly fee. However, at this point the file\\nstorage market is at times relatively inefficient; a cursory look at various existing solutions shows that,\\nparticularly at the \"uncanny valley\" 20-200 GB level at which neither free quotas nor enterprise-level discounts\\nkick in, monthly prices for mainstream file storage costs are such that you are paying for more than the cost of\\nthe entire hard drive in a single month. Ethereum contracts can allow for the development of a decentralized\\nfile storage ecosystem, where individual users can earn small quantities of money by renting out their own\\nhard drives and unused space can be used to further drive down the costs of file storage.\\nThe key underpinning piece of such a device would be what we have termed the \"decentralized Dropbox\\ncontract\". This contract works as follows. First, one splits the desired data up into blocks, encrypting each block\\nfor privacy, and builds a Merkle tree out of it. One then makes a contract with the rule that, every N blocks, the\\ncontract would pick a random index in the Merkle tree (using the previous block hash, accessible from\\ncontract code, as a source of randomness), and give X ether to the first entity to supply a transaction with a\\nethereum.org\\nsimplified payment verification-like proof of ownership of the block at that particular index in the tree. When a\\nuser wants to re-download their file, they can use a micropayment channel protocol (eg. pay 1 szabo per 32\\nkilobytes) to recover the file; the most fee-efficient approach is for the payer not to publish the transaction until\\nthe end, instead replacing the transaction with a slightly more lucrative one with the same nonce after every\\n32 kilobytes.\\nAn important feature of the protocol is that, although it may seem like one is trusting many random nodes not\\nto decide to forget the file, one can reduce that risk down to near-zero by splitting the file into many pieces via\\nsecret sharing, and watching the contracts to see each piece is still in some node\\'s possession. If a contract is\\nstill paying out money, that provides a cryptographic proof that someone out there is still storing the file.\\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations\\nThe general concept of a \"decentralized organization\" is that of a virtual entity that has a certain set of\\nmembers or shareholders which, perhaps with a 67% majority, have the right to spend the entity\\'s funds and\\nmodify its code. The members would collectively decide on how the organization should allocate its funds.\\nMethods for allocating a DAO\\'s funds could range from bounties, salaries to even more exotic mechanisms\\nsuch as an internal currency to reward work. This essentially replicates the legal trappings of a traditional\\ncompany or nonprofit but using only cryptographic blockchain technology for enforcement. So far much of the\\ntalk around DAOs has been around the \"capitalist\" model of a \"decentralized autonomous corporation\" (DAC)\\nwith\\ndividend-receiving\\nshareholders\\nand\\ntradable\\nshares;\\nan\\nalternative,\\nperhaps\\ndescribed\\nas\\na\\n\"decentralized autonomous community\", would have all members have an equal share in the decision\\nmaking and require 67% of existing members to agree to add or remove a member. The requirement that one\\nperson can only have one membership would then need to be enforced collectively by the group.\\nA general outline for how to code a DO is as follows. The simplest design is simply a piece of self-modifying\\ncode that changes if two thirds of members agree on a change. Although code is theoretically immutable, one\\ncan easily get around this and have de-facto mutability by having chunks of the code in separate contracts,\\nand\\nhaving\\nthe\\naddress of which contracts to call stored in the modifiable storage. In a simple\\nimplementation of such a DAO contract, there would be three transaction types, distinguished by the data\\nprovided in the transaction:\\n●\\n[0,i,K,V]to register a proposal with index i to change the address at storage index K to\\nvalue V\\n●\\n[0,i] to register a vote in favor of proposal i\\n●\\n[2,i] to finalize proposal i if enough votes have been made\\nThe contract would then have clauses for each of these. It would maintain a record of all open storage\\nchanges, along with a list of who voted for them. It would also have a list of all members. When any storage\\nethereum.org\\nchange gets to two thirds of members voting for it, a finalizing transaction could execute the change. A more\\nsophisticated skeleton would also have built-in voting ability for features like sending a transaction, adding\\nmembers and removing members, and may even provide for Liquid Democracy-style vote delegation (ie.\\nanyone can assign someone to vote for them, and assignment is transitive so if A assigns B and B assigns C\\nthen C determines A\\'s vote). This design would allow the DO to grow organically as a decentralized\\ncommunity, allowing people to eventually delegate the task of filtering out who is a member to specialists,\\nalthough unlike in the \"current system\" specialists can easily pop in and out of existence over time as\\nindividual community members change their alignments.\\nAn alternative model is for a decentralized corporation, where any account can have zero or more shares, and\\ntwo thirds of the shares are required to make a decision. A complete skeleton would involve asset\\nmanagement functionality, the ability to make an offer to buy or sell shares, and the ability to accept offers\\n(preferably with an order-matching mechanism inside the contract). Delegation would also exist Liquid\\nDemocracy-style, generalizing the concept of a \"board of directors\".\\nIn the future, more advanced mechanisms for organizational governance may be implemented; it is at this\\npoint that a decentralized organization (DO) can start to be described as a decentralized autonomous\\norganization (DAO). The difference between a DO and a DAO is fuzzy, but the general dividing line is whether\\nthe governance is generally carried out via a political-like process or an “automatic” process; a good intuitive\\ntest is the “no common language” criterion: can the organization still function if no two members spoke the\\nsame language? Clearly, a simple traditional shareholder-style corporation would fail, whereas something like\\nthe Bitcoin protocol would be much more likely to succeed. Robin Hanson’s futarchy, a mechanism for\\norganizational governance via prediction markets, is a good example of what truly “autonomous” governance\\nmight look like. Note that one should not necessarily assume that all DAOs are superior to all DOs; automation\\nis simply a paradigm that is likely to have have very large benefits in certain particular places and may not be\\npractical in others, and many semi-DAOs are also likely to exist.\\nFurther Applications\\n1. Savings wallets. Suppose that Alice wants to keep her funds safe, but is worried that she will lose or\\nsomeone will hack her private key. She puts ether into a contract with Bob, a bank, as follows:\\n●\\nAlice alone can withdraw a maximum of 1% of the funds per day.\\n●\\nBob alone can withdraw a maximum of 1% of the funds per day, but Alice has the ability to make a\\ntransaction with her key shutting off this ability.\\n●\\nAlice and Bob together can withdraw anything.\\nNormally, 1% per day is enough for Alice, and if Alice wants to withdraw more she can contact Bob for help.

One can easily make a financial derivatives contract but using a data feed of the weather\\ninstead of any price index. If a farmer in Iowa purchases a derivative that pays out inversely based on the\\nprecipitation in Iowa, then if there is a drought, the farmer will automatically receive money and if there is\\nenough rain the farmer will be happy because their crops would do well.\\n3. A decentralized data feed. For financial contracts for difference, it may actually be possible to decentralize\\nthe data feed via a protocol called \"SchellingCoin\". SchellingCoin basically works as follows: N parties all put\\ninto the system the value of a given datum (eg. the ETH/USD price), the values are sorted, and everyone\\nbetween the 25th and 75th percentile gets one token as a reward. Everyone has the incentive to provide the\\nanswer that everyone else will provide, and the only value that a large number of players can realistically\\nagree on is the obvious default: the truth. This creates a decentralized protocol that can theoretically provide\\nany number of values, including the ETH/USD price, the temperature in Berlin or even the result of a particular\\nhard computation.\\n4. Smart multi-signature escrow. Bitcoin allows multisignature transaction contracts where, for example,\\nthree out of a given five keys can spend the funds. Ethereum allows for more granularity; for example, four out\\nof five can spend everything, three out of five can spend up to 10% per day, and two out of five can spend up to\\n0.5% per day. Additionally, Ethereum multisig is asynchronous - two parties can register their signatures on\\nthe blockchain at different times and the last signature will automatically send the transaction.\\n5. Cloud computing. The EVM technology can also be used to create a verifiable computing environment,\\nallowing users to ask others to carry out computations and then optionally ask for proofs that computations at\\ncertain randomly selected checkpoints were done correctly. This allows for the creation of a cloud computing\\nmarket where any user can participate with their desktop, laptop or specialized server, and spot-checking\\ntogether with security deposits can be used to ensure that the system is trustworthy (ie. nodes cannot\\nprofitably cheat). Although such a system may not be suitable for all tasks; tasks that require a high level of\\ninter-process communication, for example, cannot easily be done on a large cloud of nodes. Other tasks,\\nhowever, are much easier to parallelize; projects like [EMAIL] [EMAIL] and genetic algorithms can\\neasily be implemented on top of such a platform.\\n6. Peer-to-peer gambling. Any number of peer-to-peer gambling protocols, such as Frank Stajano and\\nRichard Clayton\\'s Cyberdice, can be implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. The simplest gambling\\nprotocol is actually simply a contract for difference on the next block hash, and more advanced protocols can\\nbe built up from there, creating gambling services with near-zero fees that have no ability to cheat.\\n7. Prediction markets. Provided an oracle or SchellingCoin, prediction markets are also easy to implement,\\nand prediction markets together with SchellingCoin may prove to be the first mainstream application of\\nfutarchy as a governance protocol for decentralized organizations.\\n8. On-chain decentralized marketplaces, using the identity and reputation system as a base.\\nethereum.org\\nMiscellanea And Concerns\\nModified GHOST Implementation\\nThe \"Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree\" (GHOST) protocol is an innovation first introduced by Yonatan\\nSompolinsky and Aviv Zohar in December 2013. The motivation behind GHOST is that blockchains with fast\\nconfirmation times currently suffer from reduced security due to a high stale rate - because blocks take a\\ncertain time to propagate through the network, if miner A mines a block and then miner B happens to mine\\nanother block before miner A\\'s block propagates to B, miner B\\'s block will end up wasted and will not contribute\\nto network security. Furthermore, there is a centralization issue: if miner A is a mining pool with 30%\\nhashpower and B has 10% hashpower, A will have a risk of producing a stale block 70% of the time (since the\\nother 30% of the time A produced the last block and so will get mining data immediately) whereas B will have\\na risk of producing a stale block 90% of the time. Thus, if the block interval is short enough for the stale rate to\\nbe high, A will be substantially more efficient simply by virtue of its size. With these two effects combined,\\nblockchains which produce blocks quickly are very likely to lead to one mining pool having a large enough\\npercentage of the network hashpower to have de facto control over the mining process.\\nAs described by Sompolinsky and Zohar, GHOST solves the first issue of network security loss by including\\nstale blocks in the calculation of which chain is the \"longest\"; that is to say, not just the parent and further\\nancestors of a block, but also the stale children of the block\\'s ancestors (in Ethereum jargon, \"uncles\") are\\nadded to the calculation of which block has the largest total proof of work backing it. To solve the second issue\\nof centralization bias, we go beyond the protocol described by Sompolinsky and Zohar, and also allow stales to\\nbe registered into the main chain to receive a block reward: a stale block receives 93.75% of its base reward,\\nand the nephew that includes the stale block receives the remaining 6.25%. Transaction fees, however, are not\\nawarded to uncles.\\nEthereum implements a simplified version of GHOST which only goes down five levels. Specifically, a stale\\nblock can only be included as an uncle by the 2nd to 5th generation child of its parent, and not any block with\\na more distant relation (eg. 6th generation child of a parent, or 3rd generation child of a grandparent). This\\nwas done for several reasons. First, unlimited GHOST would include too many complications into the\\ncalculation of which uncles for a given block are valid. Second, unlimited GHOST with compensation as used\\nin Ethereum removes the incentive for a miner to mine on the main chain and not the chain of a public\\nattacker. Finally, calculations show that five-level GHOST with incentivization is over 95% efficient even with a\\n15s block time, and miners with 25% hashpower show centralization gains of less than 3%.\\nethereum.org\\nFees\\nBecause every transaction published into the blockchain imposes on the network the cost of needing to\\ndownload and verify it, there is a need for some regulatory mechanism, typically involving transaction fees, to\\nprevent abuse. The default approach, used in Bitcoin, is to have purely voluntary fees, relying on miners to act\\nas the gatekeepers and set dynamic minimums. This approach has been received very favorably in the\\nBitcoin community particularly because it is \"market-based\", allowing supply and demand between miners\\nand transaction senders determine the price. The problem with this line of reasoning is, however, that\\ntransaction processing is not a market; although it is intuitively attractive to construe transaction processing\\nas a service that the miner is offering to the sender, in reality every transaction that a miner includes will need\\nto be processed by every node in the network, so the vast majority of the cost of transaction processing is borne\\nby third parties and not the miner that is making the decision of whether or not to include it. Hence,\\ntragedy-of-the-commons problems are very likely to occur.\\nHowever, as it turns out this flaw in the market-based mechanism, when given a particular inaccurate\\nsimplifying assumption, magically cancels itself out. The argument is as follows. Suppose that:\\n1.\\nA transaction leads to k operations, offering the reward kR to any miner that includes it where R is\\nset by the sender and k and R are (roughly) visible to the miner beforehand.\\n2.\\nAn operation has a processing cost of C to any node (ie. all nodes have equal efficiency)\\n3.\\nThere are N mining nodes, each with exactly equal processing power (ie. 1/N of total)\\n4.\\nNo non-mining full nodes exist.\\nA miner would be willing to process a transaction if the expected reward is greater than the cost. Thus, the\\nexpected reward is kR/N since the miner has a 1/N chance of processing the next block, and the processing\\ncost for the miner is simply kC. Hence, miners will include transactions where kR/N > kC, or R > NC. Note that R\\nis the per-operation fee provided by the sender, and is thus a lower bound on the benefit that the sender derives\\nfrom the transaction, and NC is the cost to the entire network together of processing an operation. Hence,\\nminers have the incentive to include only those transactions for which the total utilitarian benefit exceeds the\\ncost.\\nHowever, there are several important deviations from those assumptions in reality:\\n1.\\nThe miner does pay a higher cost to process the transaction than the other verifying nodes, since\\nthe extra verification time delays block propagation and thus increases the chance the block will\\nbecome a stale.\\n2.\\nThere do exist non-mining full nodes.\\nethereum.org\\n3.\\nThe mining power distribution may end up radically inegalitarian in practice.\\n4.\\nSpeculators, political enemies and crazies whose utility function includes causing harm to the\\nnetwork do exist, and they can cleverly set up contracts whose cost is much lower than the cost\\npaid by other verifying nodes.\\nPoint 1 above provides a tendency for the miner to include fewer transactions, and point 2 increases NC;\\nhence, these two effects at least partially cancel each other out. Points 3 and 4 are the major issue; to solve\\nthem we simply institute a floating cap: no block can have more operations than BLK_LIMIT_FACTOR times the\\nlong-term exponential moving average. Specifically:\\nblk.oplimit = floor((blk.parent.oplimit * (EMAFACTOR - 1) + floor(parent.opcount * BLK_LIMIT_FACTOR)) /\\nEMA_FACTOR)\\nBLK_LIMIT_FACTOR and EMA_FACTOR are constants that will be set to 65536 and 1.5 for the time being, but\\nwill likely be changed after further analysis.\\nComputation And Turing-Completeness\\nAn important note is that the Ethereum virtual machine is Turing-complete; this means that EVM code can\\nencode any computation that can be conceivably carried out, including infinite loops. EVM code allows looping\\nin two ways. First, there is a JUMP instruction that allows the program to jump back to a previous spot in the\\ncode, and a JUMPI instruction to do conditional jumping, allowing for statements like while x < 27: x = x * 2.\\nSecond, contracts can call other contracts, potentially allowing for looping through recursion. This naturally\\nleads to a problem: can malicious users essentially shut miners and full nodes down by forcing them to enter\\ninto an infinite loop? The issue arises because of a problem in computer science known as the halting problem:\\nthere is no way to tell, in the general case, whether or not a given program will ever halt.\\nAs described in the state transition section, our solution works by requiring a transaction to set a maximum\\nnumber of computational steps that it is allowed to take, and if execution takes longer computation is reverted\\nbut fees are still paid. Messages work in the same way. To show the motivation behind our solution, consider\\nthe following examples:\\n●\\nAn attacker creates a contract which runs an infinite loop, and then sends a transaction\\nactivating that loop to the miner. The miner will process the transaction, running the infinite loop,\\nand wait for it to run out of gas. Even though the execution runs out of gas and stops halfway\\nthrough, the transaction is still valid and the miner still claims the fee from the attacker for each\\ncomputational step.\\n●\\nAn attacker creates a very long infinite loop with the intent of forcing the miner to keep\\ncomputing for such a long time that by the time computation finishes a few more blocks will have\\ncome out and it will not be possible for the miner to include the transaction to claim the fee. However,\\nethereum.org\\nthe attacker will be required to submit a value for STARTGAS limiting the number of computational\\nsteps that execution can take, so the miner will know ahead of time that the computation will take an\\nexcessively large number of steps.\\n●\\nAn attacker sees a contract with code of some form like send(A,contract.storage[A]);\\ncontract.storage[A] = 0, and sends a transaction with just enough gas to run the first step but not the\\nsecond (ie. making a withdrawal but not letting the balance go down). The contract author does not\\nneed to worry about protecting against such attacks, because if execution stops halfway through the\\nchanges get reverted.\\n●\\nA financial contract works by taking the median of nine proprietary data feeds in order to\\nminimize risk. An attacker takes over one of the data feeds, which is designed to be modifiable via\\nthe variable-address-call mechanism described in the section on DAOs, and converts it to run an\\ninfinite loop, thereby attempting to force any attempts to claim funds from the financial contract to\\nrun out of gas. However, the financial contract can set a gas limit on the message to prevent this\\nproblem.\\nThe alternative to Turing-completeness is Turing-incompleteness, where JUMP and JUMPI do not exist and\\nonly one copy of each contract is allowed to exist in the call stack at any given time. With this system, the fee\\nsystem described and the uncertainties around the effectiveness of our solution might not be necessary, as\\nthe cost of executing a contract would be bounded above by its size. Additionally, Turing-incompleteness is not\\neven that big a limitation; out of all the contract examples we have conceived internally, so far only one\\nrequired a loop, and even that loop could be removed by making 26 repetitions of a one-line piece of code.\\nGiven the serious implications of Turing-completeness, and the limited benefit, why not simply have a\\nTuring-incomplete language? In reality, however, Turing-incompleteness is far from a neat solution to the\\nproblem. To see why, consider the following contracts:\\nC0:\\xa0call(C1);\\xa0call(C1);\\xa0\\nC1:\\xa0call(C2);\\xa0call(C2);\\xa0\\nC2:\\xa0call(C3);\\xa0call(C3);\\xa0\\nC49:\\xa0call(C50);\\xa0call(C50);\\xa0\\nC50:\\xa0(run one step of a program and record the change in storage)\\nNow, send a transaction to A. Thus, in 51 transactions, we have a contract that takes up 250 computational\\nsteps. Miners could try to detect such logic bombs ahead of time by maintaining a value alongside each\\ncontract specifying the maximum number of computational steps that it can take, and calculating this for\\ncontracts calling other contracts recursively, but that would require miners to forbid contracts that create\\nother contracts (since the creation and execution of all 50 contracts above could easily be rolled into a single\\ncontract). Another problematic point is that the address field of a message is a variable, so in general it may\\nnot even be possible to tell which other contracts a given contract will call ahead of time. Hence, all in all, we\\nhave a surprising conclusion: Turing-completeness is surprisingly easy to manage, and the lack of\\nethereum.org\\nTuring-completeness is equally surprisingly difficult to manage unless the exact same controls are in place -\\nbut in that case why not just let the protocol be Turing-complete?\\nCurrency And Issuance\\nThe Ethereum network includes its own built-in currency, ether, which serves the dual purpose of providing a\\nprimary liquidity layer to allow for efficient exchange between various types of digital assets and, more\\nimportantly, of providing a mechanism for paying transaction fees. For convenience and to avoid future\\nargument (see the current mBTC/uBTC/satoshi debate in Bitcoin), the denominations will be pre-labelled:\\n●\\n1: wei\\n●\\n10^12: szabo\\n●\\n10^15: finney\\n●\\n10^18: ether\\nThis should be taken as an expanded version of the concept of \"dollars\" and \"cents\" or \"BTC\" and \"satoshi\". In the near future, we expect \"ether\" to be\\nused for ordinary transactions, \"finney\" for microtransactions and \"szabo\" and \"wei\" for technical discussions around fees and protocol\\nimplementation.\\nThe issuance model will be as follows:\\n●\\nEther will be released in a currency sale at the price of 1337-2000 ether per BTC, a\\nmechanism intended to fund the Ethereum organization and pay for development that has been\\nused with success by a number of other cryptographic platforms. Earlier buyers will benefit from larger\\ndiscounts. The BTC received from the sale will be used entirely to pay salaries and bounties to\\ndevelopers, researchers and projects in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\\n●\\n0.099x the total amount sold will be allocated to early contributors who participated in\\ndevelopment before BTC funding or certainty of funding was available, and another 0.099x will be\\nallocated to long-term research projects.\\n●\\n0.26x the total amount sold will be allocated to miners per year forever after that point.\\nethereum.org\\nIssuance Breakdown\\nThe permanent linear supply growth model reduces the risk of what some see as excessive wealth\\nconcentration in Bitcoin, and gives individuals living in present and future eras a fair chance to acquire\\ncurrency units, while at the same time discouraging depreciation of ether because the \"supply growth rate\" as\\na percentage still tends to zero over time. We also theorize that because coins are always lost over time due to\\ncarelessness, death, etc, and coin loss can be modeled as a percentage of the total supply per year, that the\\ntotal currency supply in circulation will in fact eventually stabilize at a value equal to the annual issuance\\ndivided by the loss rate (eg. at a loss rate of 1%, once the supply reaches 26X then 0.26X will be mined and\\n0.26X lost every year, creating an equilibrium).\\nGroup\\nAt launch\\nAfter 1 year\\nAfter 5 years\\nCurrency units\\n1.198X\\n1.458X\\n2.498X\\nPurchasers\\n83.5%\\n68.6%\\n40.0%\\nEarly contributor distribution\\n8.26%\\n6.79%\\n3.96%\\nLong-term endowment\\n8.26%\\n6.79%\\n3.96%\\nMiners\\n0%\\n17.8%\\n52.0%\\nDespite the linear currency issuance, just like with Bitcoin over time the supply growth rate nevertheless tends\\nto zero.\\nethereum.org\\nMining Centralization\\nThe Bitcoin mining algorithm basically works by having miners compute SHA256 on slightly modified\\nversions of the block header millions of times over and over again, until eventually one node comes up with a\\nversion whose hash is less than the target (currently around 2190). However, this mining algorithm is\\nvulnerable to two forms of centralization. First, the mining ecosystem has come to be dominated by ASICs\\n(application-specific integrated circuits), computer chips designed for, and therefore thousands of times more\\nefficient at, the specific task of Bitcoin mining. This means that Bitcoin mining is no longer a highly\\ndecentralized and egalitarian pursuit, requiring millions of dollars of capital to effectively participate in.\\nSecond, most Bitcoin miners do not actually perform block validation locally; instead, they rely on a\\ncentralized mining pool to provide the block headers. This problem is arguably worse: as of the time of this\\nwriting, the top two mining pools indirectly control roughly 50% of processing power in the Bitcoin network,\\nalthough this is mitigated by the fact that miners can switch to other mining pools if a pool or coalition\\nattempts a 51% attack.\\nThe current intent at Ethereum is to use a mining algorithm based on randomly generating a unique hash\\nfunction for every 1000 nonces, using a sufficiently broad range of computation to remove the benefit of\\nspecialized hardware. Such a strategy will certainly not reduce the gain of centralization to zero, but it does\\nnot need to. Note that each individual user, on their private laptop or desktop, can perform a certain quantity of\\nmining activity almost for free, paying only electricity costs, but after the point of 100% CPU utilization of their\\ncomputer additional mining will require them to pay for both electricity and hardware. ASIC mining companies\\nneed to pay for electricity and hardware starting from the first hash. Hence, if the centralization gain can be\\nkept to below this ratio, (E + H) / E, then even if ASICs are made there will still be room for ordinary miners.\\nAdditionally, we intend to design the mining algorithm so that mining requires access to the entire\\nblockchain, forcing miners to store the entire blockchain and at least be capable of verifying every transaction.\\nThis removes the need for centralized mining pools; although mining pools can still serve the legitimate role\\nof evening out the randomness of reward distribution, this function can be served equally well by peer-to-peer\\npools with no central control. It additionally helps fight centralization, by increasing the number of full nodes in\\nthe network so that the network remains reasonably decentralized even if most ordinary users prefer light\\nclients.\\nethereum.org\\nScalability\\nOne common concern about Ethereum is the issue of scalability. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum suffers from the flaw\\nthat every transaction needs to be processed by every node in the network. With Bitcoin, the size of the current\\nblockchain rests at about 20 GB, growing by about 1 MB per hour. If the Bitcoin network were to process Visa\\'s\\n2000 transactions per second, it would grow by 1 MB per three seconds (1 GB per hour, 8 TB per year).\\nEthereum is likely to suffer a similar growth pattern, worsened by the fact that there will be many applications\\non top of the Ethereum blockchain instead of just a currency as is the case with Bitcoin, but ameliorated by the\\nfact that Ethereum full nodes need to store just the state instead of the entire blockchain history.\\nThe problem with such a large blockchain size is centralization risk. If the blockchain size increases to, say,\\n100 TB, then the likely scenario would be that only a very small number of large businesses would run full\\nnodes, with all regular users using light SPV nodes. In such a situation, there arises the potential concern that\\nthe full nodes could band together and all agree to cheat in some profitable fashion (eg. change the block\\nreward, give themselves BTC). Light nodes would have no way of detecting this immediately. Of course, at\\nleast one honest full node would likely exist, and after a few hours information about the fraud would trickle out\\nthrough channels like Reddit, but at that point it would be too late: it would be up to the ordinary users to\\norganize an effort to blacklist the given blocks, a massive and likely infeasible coordination problem on a\\nsimilar scale as that of pulling off a successful 51% attack. In the case of Bitcoin, this is currently a problem,\\nbut there exists a blockchain modification suggested by Peter Todd which will alleviate this issue.\\nIn the near term, Ethereum will use two additional strategies to cope with this problem. First, because of the\\nblockchain-based mining algorithms, at least every miner will be forced to be a full node, creating a lower\\nbound on the number of full nodes. Second and more importantly, however, we will include an intermediate\\nstate tree root in the blockchain after processing each transaction. Even if block validation is centralized, as\\nlong as one honest verifying node exists, the centralization problem can be circumvented via a verification\\nprotocol. If a miner publishes an invalid block, that block must either be badly formatted, or the state S[n] is\\nincorrect. Since S[0] is known to be correct, there must be some first state S[i] that is incorrect where S[i-1] is\\ncorrect. The verifying node would provide the index i, along with a \"proof of invalidity\" consisting of the subset\\nof Patricia tree nodes needing to process APPLY(S[i-1],TX[i]) -> S[i]. Nodes would be able to use those nodes to\\nrun that part of the computation, and see that the S[i] generated does not match the S[i] provided.\\nAnother, more sophisticated, attack would involve the malicious miners publishing incomplete blocks, so the\\nfull information does not even exist to determine whether or not blocks are valid. The solution to this is a\\nchallenge-response protocol: verification nodes issue \"challenges\" in the form of target transaction indices,\\nand upon receiving a node a light node treats the block as untrusted until another node, whether the miner or\\nanother verifier, provides a subset of Patricia nodes as a proof of validity.\\nethereum.org\\nPutting It All Together: Decentralized Applications\\nThe contract mechanism described above allows anyone to build what is essentially a command line\\napplication run on a virtual machine that is executed by consensus across the entire network, allowing it to\\nmodify a globally accessible state as its “hard drive”. However, for most people, the command line interface\\nthat is the transaction sending mechanism is not sufficiently user-friendly to make decentralization an\\nattractive mainstream alternative. To this end, a complete “decentralized application” should consist of both\\nlow-level\\nbusiness-logic components, whether implemented entirely on Ethereum, using a combination of\\nEthereum and other systems (eg. a P2P messaging layer, one of which is currently planned to be put into the\\nEthereum clients) or other systems entirely, and high-level graphical user interface components. The\\nEthereum client’s design is to serve as a web browser, but include support for a “eth” Javascript API object,\\nwhich specialized web pages viewed in the client will be able to use to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.\\nFrom the point of view of the “traditional” web, these web pages are entirely static content, since the blockchain\\nand other decentralized protocols will serve as a complete replacement for the server for the purpose of\\nhandling user-initiated requests. Eventually, decentralized protocols, hopefully themselves in some fashion\\nusing Ethereum, may be used to store the web pages themselves.\\nConclusion\\nThe Ethereum protocol was originally conceived as an upgraded version of a cryptocurrency, providing\\nadvanced features such as on-blockchain escrow, withdrawal limits and financial contracts, gambling\\nmarkets and the like via a highly generalized programming language. The Ethereum protocol would not\\n\"support\" any of the applications directly, but the existence of a Turing-complete programming language\\nmeans that arbitrary contracts can theoretically be created for any transaction type or application. What is\\nmore interesting about Ethereum, however, is that the Ethereum protocol moves far beyond just currency.\\nProtocols\\nand decentralized applications around decentralized file storage, decentralized computation and\\ndecentralized prediction markets, among dozens of other such concepts, have the potential to substantially\\nincrease the efficiency of the computational industry, and provide a massive boost to other peer-to-peer\\nprotocols by adding for the first time an economic layer. Finally, there is also a substantial array of\\napplications that have nothing to do with money at all.\\nThe concept of an arbitrary state transition function as implemented by the Ethereum protocol provides for a\\nplatform with unique potential; rather than being a closed-ended, single-purpose protocol intended for a\\nspecific array of applications in data storage, gambling or finance, Ethereum is open-ended by design, and we\\nbelieve that it is extremely well-suited to serving as a foundational layer for a very large number of both\\nfinancial and non-financial protocols in the years to come.\\nethereum.org\\nNotes and Further Reading\\nNotes\\n1.\\nA sophisticated reader may notice that in fact a Bitcoin address is the hash of the elliptic curve\\npublic key, and not the public key itself. However, it is in fact perfectly legitimate cryptographic terminology to\\nrefer to the pubkey hash as a public key itself.

The blockchain paradigm when coupled with cryptographically-secured transactions has demonstrated its\\nutility through a number of projects, not least Bitcoin.\\nEach such project can be seen as a simple application on\\na decentralised, but singleton, compute resource. We can call this paradigm a transactional singleton machine with\\nshared-state.\\nEthereum implements this paradigm in a generalised manner. Furthermore it provides a plurality of such resources,\\neach with a distinct state and operating code but able to interact through a message-passing framework with others.\\nWe discuss its design, implementation issues, the opportunities it provides and the future hurdles we envisage.\\n1. Introduction\\nWith ubiquitous internet connections in most places\\nof the world, global information transmission has become\\nincredibly cheap. Technology-rooted movements like Bit-\\ncoin have demonstrated, through the power of the default,\\nconsensus mechanisms and voluntary respect of the social\\ncontract that it is possible to use the internet to make\\na decentralised value-transfer system, shared across the\\nworld and virtually free to use. This system can be said\\nto be a very specialised version of a cryptographically se-\\ncure, transaction-based state machine. Follow-up systems\\nsuch as Namecoin adapted this original “currency appli-\\ncation” of the technology into other applications albeit\\nrather simplistic ones.\\nEthereum is a project which attempts to build the gen-\\neralised technology; technology on which all transaction-\\nbased state machine concepts may be built. Moreover it\\naims to provide to the end-developer a tightly integrated\\nend-to-end system for building software on a hitherto un-\\nexplored compute paradigm in the mainstream: a trustful\\nobject messaging compute framework.\\n1.1. Driving Factors. There are many goals of this\\nproject; one key goal is to facilitate transactions be-\\ntween consenting individuals who would otherwise have\\nno means to trust one another.\\nThis may be due to\\ngeographical separation, interfacing difficulty, or perhaps\\nthe incompatibility, incompetence, unwillingness, expense,\\nuncertainty, inconvenience or corruption of existing legal\\nsystems. By specifying a state-change system through a\\nrich and unambiguous language, and furthermore archi-\\ntecting a system such that we can reasonably expect that\\nan agreement will be thus enforced autonomously, we can\\nprovide a means to this end.\\nDealings in this proposed system would have several\\nattributes not often found in the real world. The incor-\\nruptibility of judgement, often difficult to find, comes nat-\\nurally from a disinterested algorithmic interpreter. Trans-\\nparency, or being able to see exactly how a state or judge-\\nment came about through the transaction log and rules\\nor instructional codes, never happens perfectly in human-\\nbased systems since natural language is necessarily vague,\\ninformation is often lacking, and plain old prejudices are\\ndifficult to shake.\\nOverall, I wish to provide a system such that users can\\nbe guaranteed that no matter with which other individ-\\nuals, systems or organisations they interact, they can do\\nso with absolute confidence in the possible outcomes and\\nhow those outcomes might come about.\\n1.2. Previous Work. Buterin [2013a] first proposed the\\nkernel of this work in late November, 2013. Though now\\nevolved in many ways, the key functionality of a block-\\nchain with a Turing-complete language and an effectively\\nunlimited inter-transaction storage capability remains un-\\nchanged.\\nDwork and Naor [1992] provided the first work into the\\nusage of a cryptographic proof of computational expendi-\\nture (“proof-of-work”) as a means of transmitting a value\\nsignal over the Internet. The value-signal was utilised here\\nas a spam deterrence mechanism rather than any kind\\nof currency, but critically demonstrated the potential for\\na basic data channel to carry a strong economic signal,\\nallowing a receiver to make a physical assertion without\\nhaving to rely upon trust. Back [2002] later produced a\\nsystem in a similar vein.\\nThe first example of utilising the proof-of-work as a\\nstrong economic signal to secure a currency was by Vish-\\nnumurthy et al. [2003]. In this instance, the token was\\nused to keep peer-to-peer file trading in check, ensuring\\n“consumers” be able to make micro-payments to “suppli-\\ners” for their services.\\nThe security model afforded by\\nthe proof-of-work was augmented with digital signatures\\nand a ledger in order to ensure that the historical record\\ncouldn’t be corrupted and that malicious actors could not\\nspoof payment or unjustly complain about service deliv-\\nery.\\nFive years later, Nakamoto [2008] introduced an-\\nother such proof-of-work-secured value token, somewhat\\nwider in scope. The fruits of this project, Bitcoin, became\\nthe first widely adopted global decentralised transaction\\nledger.\\nOther projects built on Bitcoin’s success; the alt-coins\\nintroduced numerous other currencies through alteration\\nto the protocol. Some of the best known are Litecoin and\\nPrimecoin, discussed by Sprankel [2013]. Other projects\\nsought to take the core value content mechanism of the\\nETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER\\nEIP-150 REVISION\\nprotocol and repurpose it; Aron [2012] discusses, for ex-\\nample, the Namecoin project which aims to provide a de-\\ncentralised name-resolution system.\\nOther projects still aim to build upon the Bitcoin net-\\nwork itself, leveraging the large amount of value placed in\\nthe system and the vast amount of computation that goes\\ninto the consensus mechanism. The Mastercoin project,\\nfirst proposed by Willett [2013], aims to build a richer\\nprotocol involving many additional high-level features on\\ntop of the Bitcoin protocol through utilisation of a num-\\nber of auxiliary parts to the core protocol. The Coloured\\nCoins project, proposed by Rosenfeld [2012], takes a sim-\\nilar but more simplified strategy, embellishing the rules\\nof a transaction in order to break the fungibility of Bit-\\ncoin’s base currency and allow the creation and tracking of\\ntokens through a special “chroma-wallet”-protocol-aware\\npiece of software.\\nAdditional work has been done in the area with discard-\\ning the decentralisation foundation; Ripple, discussed by\\nBoutellier and Heinzen [2014], has sought to create a “fed-\\nerated” system for currency exchange, effectively creating\\na new financial clearing system. It has demonstrated that\\nhigh efficiency gains can be made if the decentralisation\\npremise is discarded.\\nEarly work on smart contracts has been done by Szabo\\n[1997] and Miller [1997]. Around the 1990s it became clear\\nthat algorithmic enforcement of agreements could become\\na significant force in human cooperation. Though no spe-\\ncific system was proposed to implement such a system,\\nit was proposed that the future of law would be heavily\\naffected by such systems.\\nIn this light, Ethereum may\\nbe seen as a general implementation of such a crypto-law\\nsystem.\\n2. The Blockchain Paradigm\\nEthereum, taken as a whole, can be viewed as a\\ntransaction-based state machine: we begin with a gene-\\nsis state and incrementally execute transactions to morph\\nit into some final state. It is this final state which we ac-\\ncept as the canonical “version” of the world of Ethereum.\\nThe state can include such information as account bal-\\nances, reputations, trust arrangements, data pertaining\\nto information of the physical world; in short, anything\\nthat can currently be represented by a computer is admis-\\nsible. Transactions thus represent a valid arc between two\\nstates; the ‘valid’ part is important-there exist far more\\ninvalid state changes than valid state changes.\\nInvalid\\nstate changes might, e.g. be things such as reducing an\\naccount balance without an equal and opposite increase\\nelsewhere.\\nA valid state transition is one which comes\\nabout through a transaction. Formally:\\n(1)\\nσt+1 ≡Υ(σt, T)\\nwhere Υ is the Ethereum state transition function. In\\nEthereum, Υ, together with σ are considerably more pow-\\nerful then any existing comparable system; Υ allows com-\\nponents to carry out arbitrary computation, while σ al-\\nlows components to store arbitrary state between trans-\\nactions.\\nTransactions are collated into blocks;\\nblocks are\\nchained together using a cryptographic hash as a means of\\nreference. Blocks function as a journal, recording a series\\nof transactions together with the previous block and an\\nidentifier for the final state (though do not store the final\\nstate itself-that would be far too big). They also punc-\\ntuate the transaction series with incentives for nodes to\\nmine. This incentivisation takes place as a state-transition\\nfunction, adding value to a nominated account.\\nMining is the process of dedicating effort (working) to\\nbolster one series of transactions (a block) over any other\\npotential competitor block.\\nIt is achieved thanks to a\\ncryptographically secure proof. This scheme is known as\\na proof-of-work and is discussed in detail in section 11.5.\\nFormally, we expand to:\\nσt+1\\n≡\\nΠ(σt, B)\\n(2)\\nB\\n≡\\n(..., (T0, T1, ...))\\n(3)\\nΠ(σ, B)\\n≡\\nΩ(B, Υ(Υ(σ, T0), T1)...)\\n(4)\\nWhere Ωis the block-finalisation state transition func-\\ntion (a function that rewards a nominated party); B is\\nthis block, which includes a series of transactions amongst\\nsome other components; and Π is the block-level state-\\ntransition function.\\nThis is the basis of the blockchain paradigm, a model\\nthat forms the backbone of not only Ethereum, but all de-\\ncentralised consensus-based transaction systems to date.\\n2.1. Value. In order to incentivise computation within\\nthe network, there needs to be an agreed method for trans-\\nmitting value. To address this issue, Ethereum has an in-\\ntrinsic currency, Ether, known also as ETH and sometimes\\nreferred to by the Old English ¯D. The smallest subdenom-\\nination of Ether, and thus the one in which all integer val-\\nues of the currency are counted, is the Wei. One Ether is\\ndefined as being 1018 Wei. There exist other subdenomi-\\nnations of Ether:\\nMultiplier\\nName\\nWei\\nSzabo\\nFinney\\nEther\\nThroughout the present work, any reference to value,\\nin the context of Ether, currency, a balance or a payment,\\nshould be assumed to be counted in Wei.\\n2.2. Which History? Since the system is decentralised\\nand all parties have an opportunity to create a new block\\non some older pre-existing block, the resultant structure is\\nnecessarily a tree of blocks. In order to form a consensus as\\nto which path, from root (the genesis block) to leaf (the\\nblock containing the most recent transactions) through\\nthis tree structure, known as the blockchain, there must\\nbe an agreed-upon scheme.\\nIf there is ever a disagree-\\nment between nodes as to which root-to-leaf path down\\nthe block tree is the ‘best’ blockchain, then a fork occurs.\\nThis would mean that past a given point in time\\n(block), multiple states of the system may coexist: some\\nnodes believing one block to contain the canonical transac-\\ntions, other nodes believing some other block to be canoni-\\ncal, potentially containing radically different or incompat-\\nible transactions. This is to be avoided at all costs as the\\nuncertainty that would ensue would likely kill all confi-\\ndence in the entire system.\\nThe scheme we use in order to generate consensus is a\\nsimplified version of the GHOST protocol introduced by\\nETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER\\nEIP-150 REVISION\\nSompolinsky and Zohar [2013]. This process is described\\nin detail in section 10.\\n3. Conventions\\nI use a number of typographical conventions for the\\nformal notation, some of which are quite particular to the\\npresent work:\\nThe two sets of highly structured, ‘top-level’, state val-\\nues, are denoted with bold lowercase Greek letters. They\\nfall into those of world-state, which are denoted σ (or a\\nvariant thereupon) and those of machine-state, µ.\\nFunctions operating on highly structured values are\\ndenoted with an upper-case greek letter, e.g. Υ, the\\nEthereum state transition function.\\nFor most functions, an uppercase letter is used, e.g.\\nC, the general cost function. These may be subscripted\\nto denote specialised variants, e.g. CSSTORE, the cost func-\\ntion for the SSTORE operation. For specialised and possibly\\nexternally defined functions, I may format as typewriter\\ntext, e.g. the Keccak-256 hash function (as per the winning\\nentry to the SHA-3 contest) is denoted KEC (and generally\\nreferred to as plain Keccak). Also KEC512 is referring to\\nthe Keccak 512 hash function.\\nTuples are typically denoted with an upper-case letter,\\ne.g. T, is used to denote an Ethereum transaction. This\\nsymbol may, if accordingly defined, be subscripted to re-\\nfer to an individual component, e.g. Tn, denotes the nonce\\nof said transaction. The form of the subscript is used to\\ndenote its type; e.g. uppercase subscripts refer to tuples\\nwith subscriptable components.\\nScalars and fixed-size byte sequences (or, synony-\\nmously, arrays) are denoted with a normal lower-case let-\\nter, e.g. n is used in the document to denote a transaction\\nnonce. Those with a particularly special meaning may be\\ngreek, e.g. δ, the number of items required on the stack\\nfor a given operation.\\nArbitrary-length sequences are typically denoted as a\\nbold lower-case letter, e.g. o is used to denote the byte-\\nsequence given as the output data of a message call. For\\nparticularly important values, a bold uppercase letter may\\nbe used.\\nThroughout, we assume scalars are positive integers\\nand thus belong to the set P. The set of all byte sequences\\nis B, formally defined in Appendix B. If such a set of se-\\nquences is restricted to those of a particular length, it is\\ndenoted with a subscript, thus the set of all byte sequences\\nof length 32 is named B32 and the set of all positive in-\\ntegers smaller than 2256 is named P256. This is formally\\ndefined in section 4.4.\\nSquare brackets are used to index into and reference\\nindividual components or subsequences of sequences, e.g.\\nµs[0] denotes the first item on the machine’s stack. For\\nsubsequences, ellipses are used to specify the intended\\nrange, to include elements at both limits, e.g. µm[0..31]\\ndenotes the first 32 items of the machine’s memory.\\nIn the case of the global state σ, which is a sequence of\\naccounts, themselves tuples, the square brackets are used\\nto reference an individual account.\\nWhen considering variants of existing values, I follow\\nthe rule that within a given scope for definition, if we\\nassume that the unmodified ‘input’ value be denoted by\\nthe placeholder □then the modified and utilisable value\\nis denoted as □′, and intermediate values would be □∗,\\n□∗∗&c. On very particular occasions, in order to max-\\nimise readability and only if unambiguous in meaning, I\\nmay use alpha-numeric subscripts to denote intermediate\\nvalues, especially those of particular note.\\nWhen considering the use of existing functions, given\\na function f, the function f ∗denotes a similar, element-\\nwise version of the function mapping instead between se-\\nquences. It is formally defined in section 4.4.\\nI define a number of useful functions throughout. One\\nof the more common is ℓ, which evaluates to the last item\\nin the given sequence:\\n(5)\\nℓ(x) ≡x[∥x∥−1]\\n4. Blocks, State and Transactions\\nHaving\\nintroduced\\nthe\\nbasic\\nconcepts\\nbehind\\nEthereum, we will discuss the meaning of a transaction, a\\nblock and the state in more detail.\\n4.1. World State. The world state (state), is a map-\\nping between addresses (160-bit identifiers) and account\\nstates (a data structure serialised as RLP, see Appendix\\nB). Though not stored on the blockchain, it is assumed\\nthat the implementation will maintain this mapping in a\\nmodified Merkle Patricia tree (trie, see Appendix D). The\\ntrie requires a simple database backend that maintains a\\nmapping of bytearrays to bytearrays; we name this under-\\nlying database the state database. This has a number of\\nbenefits; firstly the root node of this structure is crypto-\\ngraphically dependent on all internal data and as such its\\nhash can be used as a secure identity for the entire sys-\\ntem state. Secondly, being an immutable data structure,\\nit allows any previous state (whose root hash is known) to\\nbe recalled by simply altering the root hash accordingly.\\nSince we store all such root hashes in the blockchain, we\\nare able to trivially revert to old states.\\nThe account state comprises the following four fields:\\nnonce: A scalar value equal to the number of trans-\\nactions sent from this address or, in the case\\nof accounts with associated code, the number of\\ncontract-creations made by this account. For ac-\\ncount of address a in state σ, this would be for-\\nmally denoted σ[a]n.\\nbalance: A scalar value equal to the number of Wei\\nowned by this address. Formally denoted σ[a]b.\\nstorageRoot: A 256-bit hash of the root node of a\\nMerkle Patricia tree that encodes the storage con-\\ntents of the account (a mapping between 256-bit\\ninteger values), encoded into the trie as a map-\\nping from the Keccak 256-bit hash of the 256-bit\\ninteger keys to the RLP-encoded 256-bit integer\\nvalues. The hash is formally denoted σ[a]s.\\ncodeHash: The hash of the EVM code of this\\naccount-this is the code that gets executed\\nshould this address receive a message call; it is\\nimmutable and thus, unlike all other fields, can-\\nnot be changed after construction. All such code\\nfragments are contained in the state database un-\\nder their corresponding hashes for later retrieval.\\nThis hash is formally denoted σ[a]c, and thus the\\ncode may be denoted as b, given that KEC(b) =\\nσ[a]c.\\nETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER\\nEIP-150 REVISION\\nSince I typically wish to refer not to the trie’s root hash\\nbut to the underlying set of key/value pairs stored within,\\nI define a convenient equivalence:\\n(6)\\nTRIE\\nL∗\\nI(σ[a]s)\\n≡σ[a]s\\nThe collapse function for the set of key/value pairs in\\nthe trie, L∗\\nI, is defined as the element-wise transformation\\nof the base function LI, given as:\\n(7)\\nLI\\n(k, v)\\n≡\\nKEC(k), RLP(v)\\nwhere:\\n(8)\\nk ∈B32\\n∧\\nv ∈P\\nIt shall be understood that σ[a]s is not a ‘physical’\\nmember of the account and does not contribute to its later\\nserialisation.\\nIf the codeHash field is the Keccak-256 hash of the\\nempty string, i.e. σ[a]c = KEC\\n()\\n, then the node repre-\\nsents a simple account, sometimes referred to as a “non-\\ncontract” account.\\nThus we may define a world-state collapse function LS:\\n(9)\\nLS(σ) ≡{p(a) : σ[a] ̸= ∅}\\nwhere\\n(10)\\np(a) ≡\\nKEC(a), RLP\\n(σ[a]n, σ[a]b, σ[a]s, σ[a]c)\\nThis function, LS, is used alongside the trie function\\nto provide a short identity (hash) of the world state. We\\nassume:\\n(11)\\n∀a : σ[a] = ∅∨(a ∈B20 ∧v(σ[a]))\\nwhere v is the account validity function:\\n(12)\\nv(x) ≡xn ∈P256∧xb ∈P256∧xs ∈B32∧xc ∈B32\\n4.2. Homestead. A significant block number for com-\\npatibility with the public network is the block marking the\\ntransition between the Frontier and Homestead phases of\\nthe platform, which we denote with the symbol NH, de-\\nfined thus\\n(13)\\nNH ≡1,150,000\\nThe protocol was upgraded at this block, so this symbol\\nappears in some equations to account for the changes.\\n4.3. The Transaction. A transaction (formally, T) is a\\nsingle cryptographically-signed instruction constructed by\\nan actor externally to the scope of Ethereum. While is as-\\nsumed that the ultimate external actor will be human in\\nnature, software tools will be used in its construction and\\ndissemination1. There are two types of transactions: those\\nwhich result in message calls and those which result in\\nthe creation of new accounts with associated code (known\\ninformally as ‘contract creation’).\\nBoth types specify a\\nnumber of common fields:\\nnonce: A scalar value equal to the number of trans-\\nactions sent by the sender; formally Tn.\\ngasPrice: A scalar value equal to the number of\\nWei to be paid per unit of gas for all computa-\\ntion costs incurred as a result of the execution of\\nthis transaction; formally Tp.\\ngasLimit: A scalar value equal to the maximum\\namount of gas that should be used in executing\\nthis transaction. This is paid up-front, before any\\ncomputation is done and may not be increased\\nlater; formally Tg.\\nto: The 160-bit address of the message call’s recipi-\\nent or, for a contract creation transaction, ∅, used\\nhere to denote the only member of B0 ; formally\\nTt.\\nvalue: A scalar value equal to the number of Wei to\\nbe transferred to the message call’s recipient or,\\nin the case of contract creation, as an endowment\\nto the newly created account; formally Tv.\\nv, r, s: Values corresponding to the signature of the\\ntransaction and used to determine the sender of\\nthe transaction; formally Tw, Tr and Ts. This is\\nexpanded in Appendix F.\\nAdditionally, a contract creation transaction contains:\\ninit: An unlimited size byte array specifying the\\nEVM-code for the account initialisation proce-\\ndure, formally Ti.\\ninit is an EVM-code fragment; it returns the body,\\na second fragment of code that executes each time the\\naccount receives a message call (either through a trans-\\naction or due to the internal execution of code). init is\\nexecuted only once at account creation and gets discarded\\nimmediately thereafter.\\nIn contrast, a message call transaction contains:\\ndata: An unlimited size byte array specifying the\\ninput data of the message call, formally Td.\\nAppendix F specifies the function, S, which maps\\ntransactions to the sender, and happens through the\\nECDSA of the SECP-256k1 curve, using the hash of the\\ntransaction (excepting the latter three signature fields) as\\nthe datum to sign. For the present we simply assert that\\nthe sender of a given transaction T can be represented\\nwith S(T).\\n(14)\\nLT (T) ≡\\n(\\n(Tn, Tp, Tg, Tt, Tv, Ti, Tw, Tr, Ts)\\nif Tt = ∅\\n(Tn, Tp, Tg, Tt, Tv, Td, Tw, Tr, Ts)\\notherwise\\nHere, we assume all components are interpreted by the\\nRLP as integer values, with the exception of the arbitrary\\nlength byte arrays Ti and Td.\\n(15)\\nTn ∈P256\\n∧\\nTv ∈P256\\n∧\\nTp ∈P256\\n∧\\nTg ∈P256\\n∧\\nTw ∈P5\\n∧\\nTr ∈P256\\n∧\\nTs ∈P256\\n∧\\nTd ∈B\\n∧\\nTi ∈B\\nwhere\\n(16)\\nPn = {P : P ∈P ∧P < 2n}\\nThe address hash Tt is slightly different: it is either a\\n20-byte address hash or, in the case of being a contract-\\ncreation transaction (and thus formally equal to ∅), it is\\nthe RLP empty byte-series and thus the member of B0:\\n(17)\\nTt ∈\\n(\\nB20\\nif\\nTt ̸= ∅\\nB0\\notherwise\\n1Notably, such ‘tools’ could ultimately become so causally removed from their human-based initiation-or humans may become so\\ncausally-neutral-that there could be a point at which they rightly be considered autonomous agents. e.g. contracts may offer bounties to\\nhumans for being sent transactions to initiate their execution.\\nETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER\\nEIP-150 REVISION\\n4.4. The Block. The block in Ethereum is the collec-\\ntion of relevant pieces of information (known as the block\\nheader), H, together with information corresponding to\\nthe comprised transactions, T, and a set of other block\\nheaders U that are known to have a parent equal to the\\npresent block’s parent’s parent (such blocks are known as\\nommers2).\\nThe block header contains several pieces of\\ninformation:\\nparentHash: The Keccak 256-bit hash of the par-\\nent block’s header, in its entirety; formally Hp.\\nommersHash: The Keccak 256-bit hash of the om-\\nmers list portion of this block; formally Ho.\\nbeneficiary: The 160-bit address to which all fees\\ncollected from the successful mining of this block\\nbe transferred; formally Hc.\\nstateRoot: The Keccak 256-bit hash of the root\\nnode of the state trie, after all transactions are\\nexecuted and finalisations applied; formally Hr.\\ntransactionsRoot: The Keccak 256-bit hash of the\\nroot node of the trie structure populated with\\neach transaction in the transactions list portion\\nof the block; formally Ht.\\nreceiptsRoot: The Keccak 256-bit hash of the root\\nnode of the trie structure populated with the re-\\nceipts of each transaction in the transactions list\\nportion of the block; formally He.\\nlogsBloom: The Bloom filter composed from in-\\ndexable information (logger address and log top-\\nics) contained in each log entry from the receipt of\\neach transaction in the transactions list; formally\\nHb.\\ndifficulty: A scalar value corresponding to the dif-\\nficulty level of this block. This can be calculated\\nfrom the previous block’s difficulty level and the\\ntimestamp; formally Hd.\\nnumber: A scalar value equal to the number of an-\\ncestor blocks. The genesis block has a number of\\nzero; formally Hi.\\ngasLimit: A scalar value equal to the current limit\\nof gas expenditure per block; formally Hl.\\ngasUsed: A scalar value equal to the total gas used\\nin transactions in this block; formally Hg.\\ntimestamp: A scalar value equal to the reasonable\\noutput of Unix’s time() at this block’s inception;\\nformally Hs.\\nextraData: An arbitrary byte array containing\\ndata relevant to this block. This must be 32 bytes\\nor fewer; formally Hx.\\nmixHash: A 256-bit hash which proves combined\\nwith the nonce that a sufficient amount of compu-\\ntation has been carried out on this block; formally\\nHm.\\nnonce: A 64-bit hash which proves combined with\\nthe mix-hash that a sufficient amount of compu-\\ntation has been carried out on this block; formally\\nHn.\\nThe other two components in the block are simply a\\nlist of ommer block headers (of the same format as above)\\nand a series of the transactions. Formally, we can refer to\\na block B:\\n(18)\\nB ≡(BH, BT, BU)\\n4.4.1. Transaction Receipt. In order to encode informa-\\ntion about a transaction concerning which it may be use-\\nful to form a zero-knowledge proof, or index and search,\\nwe encode a receipt of each transaction containing cer-\\ntain information from concerning its execution. Each re-\\nceipt, denoted BR[i] for the ith transaction) is placed in\\nan index-keyed trie and the root recorded in the header as\\nHe.\\nThe transaction receipt is a tuple of four items com-\\nprising the post-transaction state, Rσ, the cumulative gas\\nused in the block containing the transaction receipt as of\\nimmediately after the transaction has happened, Ru, the\\nset of logs created through execution of the transaction, Rl\\nand the Bloom filter composed from information in those\\nlogs, Rb:\\n(19)\\nR ≡(Rσ, Ru, Rb, Rl)\\nThe function LR trivially prepares a transaction receipt\\nfor being transformed into an RLP-serialised byte array:\\n(20)\\nLR(R) ≡(TRIE(LS(Rσ)), Ru, Rb, Rl)\\nthus the post-transaction state, Rσ is encoded into a trie\\nstructure, the root of which forms the first item.\\nWe assert Ru, the cumulative gas used is a positive in-\\nteger and that the logs Bloom, Rb, is a hash of size 2048\\nbits (256 bytes):\\n(21)\\nRu ∈P\\n∧\\nRb ∈B256\\nThe log entries, Rl, is a series of log entries, termed,\\nfor example, (O0, O1, ...). A log entry, O, is a tuple of a\\nlogger’s address, Oa, a series of 32-bytes log topics, Ot\\nand some number of bytes of data, Od:\\n(22)\\nO ≡(Oa, (Ot0, Ot1, ...), Od)\\n(23)\\nOa ∈B20\\n∧\\n∀t∈Ot : t ∈B32\\n∧\\nOd ∈B\\nWe define the Bloom filter function, M, to reduce a log\\nentry into a single 256-byte hash:\\n(24)\\nM(O) ≡\\nt∈{Oa}∪Ot\\nM3:2048(t)\\nwhere M3:2048 is a specialised Bloom filter that sets\\nthree bits out of 2048, given an arbitrary byte series. It\\ndoes this through taking the low-order 11 bits of each of\\nthe first three pairs of bytes in a Keccak-256 hash of the\\nbyte series. Formally:\\nM3:2048(x : x ∈B)\\n≡\\ny : y ∈B256\\nwhere:\\n(25)\\ny\\n=\\n(0, 0, ..., 0)\\nexcept:\\n(26)\\n∀i∈{0,2,4}\\n:\\nBm(x,i)(y) = 1\\n(27)\\nm(x, i)\\n≡\\nKEC(x)[i, i + 1] mod 2048\\n(28)\\nwhere B is the bit reference function such that Bj(x)\\nequals the bit of index j (indexed from 0) in the byte array\\nx.\\n2ommer is the most prevalent (not saying much) gender-neutral term to mean “sibling of parent”; see http://nonbinary.org/wiki/\\nGender_neutral_language#Family_Terms\\nETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER\\nEIP-150 REVISION\\n4.4.2. Holistic Validity. We can assert a block’s validity if\\nand only if it satisfies several conditions: it must be in-\\nternally consistent with the ommer and transaction block\\nhashes and the given transactions BT (as specified in sec\\n11), when executed in order on the base state σ (derived\\nfrom the final state of the parent block), result in a new\\nstate of the identity Hr:\\n(29)\\nHr\\n≡\\nTRIE(LS(Π(σ, B)))\\n∧\\nHo\\n≡\\nKEC(RLP(L∗\\nH(BU)))\\n∧\\nHt\\n≡\\nTRIE({∀i < ∥BT∥, i ∈P : p(i, LT (BT[i]))})\\n∧\\nHe\\n≡\\nTRIE({∀i < ∥BR∥, i ∈P : p(i, LR(BR[i]))})\\n∧\\nHb\\n≡\\nW\\nr∈BR\\nrb\\nwhere p(k, v) is simply the pairwise RLP transforma-\\ntion, in this case, the first being the index of the trans-\\naction in the block and the second being the transaction\\nreceipt:\\n(30)\\np(k, v) ≡\\nRLP(k), RLP(v)\\nFurthermore:\\n(31)\\nTRIE(LS(σ)) = P(BH)H r\\nThus TRIE(LS(σ)) is the root node hash of the Merkle\\nPatricia tree structure containing the key-value pairs of\\nthe state σ with values encoded using RLP, and P(BH)\\nis the parent block of B, defined directly.\\nThe values stemming from the computation of transac-\\ntions, specifically the transaction receipts, BR, and that\\ndefined through the transactions state-accumulation func-\\ntion, Π, are formalised later in section 11.4.\\n4.4.3. Serialisation. The function LB and LH are the\\npreparation functions for a block and block header respec-\\ntively. Much like the transaction receipt preparation func-\\ntion LR, we assert the types and order of the structure for\\nwhen the RLP transformation is required:\\nLH(H)\\n≡\\n( Hp, Ho, Hc, Hr, Ht, He, Hb, Hd,\\nHi, Hl, Hg, Hs, Hx, Hm, Hn )\\n(32)\\nLB(B)\\n≡\\nLH(BH), L∗\\nT (BT), L∗\\nH(BU)\\n(33)\\nWith L∗\\nT and L∗\\nH being element-wise sequence trans-\\nformations, thus:\\n(34)\\nf ∗(x0, x1, ...)\\n≡\\nf(x0), f(x1), ...\\nfor any function f\\nThe component types are defined thus:\\n(35)\\nHp ∈B32\\n∧\\nHo ∈B32\\n∧\\nHc ∈B20\\n∧\\nHr ∈B32\\n∧\\nHt ∈B32\\n∧\\nHe ∈B32\\n∧\\nHb ∈B256\\n∧\\nHd ∈P\\n∧\\nHi ∈P\\n∧\\nHl ∈P\\n∧\\nHg ∈P\\n∧\\nHs ∈P256\\n∧\\nHx ∈B\\n∧\\nHm ∈B32\\n∧\\nHn ∈B8\\nwhere\\n(36)\\nBn = {B : B ∈B ∧∥B∥= n}\\nWe now have a rigorous specification for the construc-\\ntion of a formal block structure. The RLP function RLP\\n(see Appendix B) provides the canonical method for trans-\\nforming this structure into a sequence of bytes ready for\\ntransmission over the wire or storage locally.\\n4.4.4.

Gas and Payment\\nIn order to avoid issues of network abuse and to side-\\nstep the inevitable questions stemming from Turing com-\\npleteness, all programmable computation in Ethereum is\\nsubject to fees. The fee schedule is specified in units of\\ngas (see Appendix G for the fees associated with var-\\nious computation).\\nThus any given fragment of pro-\\ngrammable computation (this includes creating contracts,\\nmaking message calls, utilising and accessing account stor-\\nage and executing operations on the virtual machine) has\\na universally agreed cost in terms of gas.\\nEvery transaction has a specific amount of gas associ-\\nated with it: gasLimit. This is the amount of gas which\\nis implicitly purchased from the sender’s account balance.\\nThe purchase happens at the according gasPrice, also\\nspecified in the transaction. The transaction is considered\\ninvalid if the account balance cannot support such a pur-\\nchase. It is named gasLimit since any unused gas at the\\nend of the transaction is refunded (at the same rate of pur-\\nchase) to the sender’s account. Gas does not exist outside\\nof the execution of a transaction. Thus for accounts with\\ntrusted code associated, a relatively high gas limit may be\\nset and left alone.\\nIn general, Ether used to purchase gas that is not re-\\nfunded is delivered to the beneficiary address, the address\\nof an account typically under the control of the miner.\\nTransactors are free to specify any gasPrice that they\\nwish, however miners are free to ignore transactions as\\nthey choose. A higher gas price on a transaction will there-\\nfore cost the sender more in terms of Ether and deliver a\\ngreater value to the miner and thus will more likely be\\nselected for inclusion by more miners. Miners, in general,\\nwill choose to advertise the minimum gas price for which\\nthey will execute transactions and transactors will be free\\nto canvas these prices in determining what gas price to\\noffer. Since there will be a (weighted) distribution of min-\\nimum acceptable gas prices, transactors will necessarily\\nhave a trade-offto make between lowering the gas price\\nand maximising the chance that their transaction will be\\nmined in a timely manner.\\n6. Transaction Execution\\nThe execution of a transaction is the most complex part\\nof the Ethereum protocol: it defines the state transition\\nfunction Υ. It is assumed that any transactions executed\\nfirst pass the initial tests of intrinsic validity. These in-\\nclude:\\n(1) The transaction is well-formed RLP, with no ad-\\nditional trailing bytes;\\n(2) the transaction signature is valid;\\n(3) the transaction nonce is valid (equivalent to the\\nsender account’s current nonce);\\n(4) the gas limit is no smaller than the intrinsic gas,\\ng0, used by the transaction;\\n(5) the sender account balance contains at least the\\ncost, v0, required in up-front payment.\\nFormally, we consider the function Υ, with T being a\\ntransaction and σ the state:\\n(59)\\nσ′ = Υ(σ, T)\\nThus σ′ is the post-transactional state. We also define\\nΥg to evaluate to the amount of gas used in the execution\\nof a transaction and Υl to evaluate to the transaction’s\\naccrued log items, both to be formally defined later.\\n6.1. Substate. Throughout transaction execution, we\\naccrue certain information that is acted upon immediately\\nfollowing the transaction.\\nWe call this transaction sub-\\nstate, and represent it as A, which is a tuple:\\n(60)\\nA ≡(As, Al, Ar)\\nThe tuple contents include As, the suicide set: a set\\nof accounts that will be discarded following the transac-\\ntion’s completion. Al is the log series: this is a series of\\narchived and indexable ‘checkpoints’ in VM code execu-\\ntion that allow for contract-calls to be easily tracked by\\nonlookers external to the Ethereum world (such as decen-\\ntralised application front-ends). Finally there is Ar, the\\nrefund balance, increased through using the SSTORE in-\\nstruction in order to reset contract storage to zero from\\nsome non-zero value. Though not immediately refunded,\\nit is allowed to partially offset the total execution costs.\\nFor brevity, we define the empty substate A0 to have\\nno suicides, no logs and a zero refund balance:\\n(61)\\nA0 ≡(∅, (), 0)\\n6.2. Execution. We define intrinsic gas g0, the amount\\nof gas this transaction requires to be paid prior to execu-\\ntion, as follows:\\ng0 ≡\\nX\\ni∈Ti,Td\\n(\\nGtxdatazero\\nif\\ni = 0\\nGtxdatanonzero\\notherwise\\n(62)\\n+\\n(\\nGtxcreate\\nif\\nTt = ∅∧Hi ≥NH\\notherwise\\n(63)\\n+ Gtransaction\\n(64)\\nETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER\\nEIP-150 REVISION\\nwhere Ti, Td means the series of bytes of the trans-\\naction’s associated data and initialisation EVM-code,\\ndepending on whether the transaction is for contract-\\ncreation or message-call. Gtxcreate is added if the transac-\\ntion is contract-creating, but not if a result of EVM-code\\nor before the Homestead transition. G is fully defined in\\nAppendix G.\\nThe up-front cost v0 is calculated as:\\n(65)\\nv0 ≡TgTp + Tv\\nThe validity is determined as:\\n(66)\\nS(T)\\n̸=\\n∅\\n∧\\nσ[S(T)]\\n̸=\\n∅\\n∧\\nTn\\n=\\nσ[S(T)]n\\n∧\\ng0\\n⩽\\nTg\\n∧\\nv0\\n⩽\\nσ[S(T)]b\\n∧\\nTg\\n⩽\\nBH l −ℓ(BR)u\\nNote the final condition; the sum of the transaction’s\\ngas limit, Tg, and the gas utilised in this block prior, given\\nby ℓ(BR)u, must be no greater than the block’s gasLimit,\\nBH l.\\nThe execution of a valid transaction begins with an\\nirrevocable change made to the state: the nonce of the ac-\\ncount of the sender, S(T), is incremented by one and the\\nbalance is reduced by part of the up-front cost, TgTp. The\\ngas available for the proceeding computation, g, is defined\\nas Tg −g0. The computation, whether contract creation\\nor a message call, results in an eventual state (which may\\nlegally be equivalent to the current state), the change to\\nwhich is deterministic and never invalid: there can be no\\ninvalid transactions from this point.\\nWe define the checkpoint state σ0:\\nσ0\\n≡\\nσ\\nexcept:\\n(67)\\nσ0[S(T)]b\\n≡\\nσ[S(T)]b −TgTp\\n(68)\\nσ0[S(T)]n\\n≡\\nσ[S(T)]n + 1\\n(69)\\nEvaluating σP from σ0 depends on the transaction\\ntype; either contract creation or message call; we define\\nthe tuple of post-execution provisional state σP , remain-\\ning gas g′ and substate A:\\n(70)\\n(σP , g′, A) ≡\\nΛ(σ0, S(T), To,\\ng, Tp, Tv, Ti, 0)\\nif\\nTt = ∅\\nΘ3(σ0, S(T), To,\\nTt, Tt, g, Tp, Tv, Tv, Td, 0)\\notherwise\\nwhere g is the amount of gas remaining after deducting\\nthe basic amount required to pay for the existence of the\\ntransaction:\\n(71)\\ng ≡Tg −g0\\nand To is the original transactor, which can differ from the\\nsender in the case of a message call or contract creation\\nnot directly triggered by a transaction but coming from\\nthe execution of EVM-code.\\nNote we use Θ3 to denote the fact that only the first\\nthree components of the function’s value are taken; the\\nfinal represents the message-call’s output value (a byte\\narray) and is unused in the context of transaction evalua-\\ntion.\\nAfter the message call or contract creation is processed,\\nthe state is finalised by determining the amount to be re-\\nfunded, g∗from the remaining gas, g′, plus some allowance\\nfrom the refund counter, to the sender at the original rate.\\n(72)\\ng∗≡g′ + min{\\njTg −g′\\nk\\n, Ar}\\nThe total refundable amount is the legitimately remain-\\ning gas g′, added to Ar, with the latter component being\\ncapped up to a maximum of half (rounded down) of the\\ntotal amount used Tg −g′.\\nThe Ether for the gas is given to the miner, whose ad-\\ndress is specified as the beneficiary of the present block\\nB.\\nSo we define the pre-final state σ∗in terms of the\\nprovisional state σP :\\nσ∗\\n≡\\nσP\\nexcept\\n(73)\\nσ∗[S(T)]b\\n≡\\nσP [S(T)]b + g∗Tp\\n(74)\\nσ∗[m]b\\n≡\\nσP [m]b + (Tg −g∗)Tp\\n(75)\\nm\\n≡\\nBH c\\n(76)\\nThe final state, σ′, is reached after deleting all accounts\\nthat appear in the suicide list:\\nσ′\\n≡\\nσ∗\\nexcept\\n(77)\\n∀i ∈As : σ′[i]\\n≡\\n∅\\n(78)\\nAnd finally, we specify Υg, the total gas used in this\\ntransaction and Υl, the logs created by this transaction:\\nΥg(σ, T)\\n≡\\nTg −g′\\n(79)\\nΥl(σ, T)\\n≡\\nAl\\n(80)\\nThese are used to help define the transaction receipt,\\ndiscussed later.\\n7. Contract Creation\\nThere are a number of intrinsic parameters used when\\ncreating an account: sender (s), original transactor (o),\\navailable gas (g), gas price (p), endowment (v) together\\nwith an arbitrary length byte array, i, the initialisation\\nEVM code and finally the present depth of the message-\\ncall/contract-creation stack (e).\\nWe define the creation function formally as the func-\\ntion Λ, which evaluates from these values, together with\\nthe state σ to the tuple containing the new state, remain-\\ning gas and accrued transaction substate (σ′, g′, A), as in\\nsection 6:\\n(81)\\n(σ′, g′, A) ≡Λ(σ, s, o, g, p, v, i, e)\\nThe address of the new account is defined as being the\\nrightmost 160 bits of the Keccak hash of the RLP encod-\\ning of the structure containing only the sender and the\\nnonce. Thus we define the resultant address for the new\\naccount a:\\n(82)\\na ≡B96..255\\nKEC\\nRLP\\n(s, σ[s]n −1)\\nwhere KEC is the Keccak 256-bit hash function, RLP is\\nthe RLP encoding function, Ba..b(X) evaluates to binary\\nvalue containing the bits of indices in the range [a, b] of\\nthe binary data X and σ[x] is the address state of x or ∅if\\nnone exists. Note we use one fewer than the sender’s nonce\\nvalue; we assert that we have incremented the sender ac-\\ncount’s nonce prior to this call, and so the value used\\nis the sender’s nonce at the beginning of the responsible\\ntransaction or VM operation.\\nThe account’s nonce is initially defined as zero, the\\nbalance as the value passed, the storage as empty and the\\ncode hash as the Keccak 256-bit hash of the empty string;\\nETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER\\nEIP-150 REVISION\\nthe sender’s balance is also reduced by the value passed.\\nThus the mutated state becomes σ∗:\\n(83)\\nσ∗≡σ\\nexcept:\\nσ∗[a]\\n≡\\n0, v + v′, TRIE(∅), KEC\\n()\\n(84)\\nσ∗[s]b\\n≡\\nσ[s]b −v\\n(85)\\nwhere v′ is the account’s pre-existing value, in the event\\nit was previously in existence:\\n(86)\\nv′ ≡\\n(\\nif\\nσ[a] = ∅\\nσ[a]b\\notherwise\\nFinally, the account is initialised through the execution\\nof the initialising EVM code i according to the execution\\nmodel (see section 9). Code execution can effect several\\nevents that are not internal to the execution state: the\\naccount’s storage can be altered, further accounts can be\\ncreated and further message calls can be made. As such,\\nthe code execution function Ξ evaluates to a tuple of the\\nresultant state σ∗∗, available gas remaining g∗∗, the ac-\\ncrued substate A and the body code of the account o.\\n(87)\\n(σ∗∗, g∗∗, A, o) ≡Ξ(σ∗, g, I)\\nwhere I contains the parameters of the execution environ-\\nment as defined in section 9, that is:\\nIa\\n≡\\na\\n(88)\\nIo\\n≡\\no\\n(89)\\nIp\\n≡\\np\\n(90)\\nId\\n≡\\n()\\n(91)\\nIs\\n≡\\ns\\n(92)\\nIv\\n≡\\nv\\n(93)\\nIb\\n≡\\ni\\n(94)\\nIe\\n≡\\ne\\n(95)\\nId evaluates to the empty tuple as there is no input\\ndata to this call. IH has no special treatment and is de-\\ntermined from the blockchain.\\nCode execution depletes gas, and gas may not go below\\nzero, thus execution may exit before the code has come to\\na natural halting state. In this (and several other) excep-\\ntional cases we say an Out-of-Gas exception has occurred:\\nThe evaluated state is defined as being the empty set, ∅,\\nand the entire create operation should have no effect on\\nthe state, effectively leaving it as it was immediately prior\\nto attempting the creation.\\nIf the initialization code completes successfully, a fi-\\nnal contract-creation cost is paid, the code-deposit cost,\\nc, proportional to the size of the created contract’s code:\\n(96)\\nc ≡Gcodedeposit × |o|\\nIf there is not enough gas remaining to pay this, i.e.\\ng∗∗< c, then we also declare an Out-of-Gas exception.\\nThe gas remaining will be zero in any such exceptional\\ncondition, i.e. if the creation was conducted as the recep-\\ntion of a transaction, then this doesn’t affect payment of\\nthe intrinsic cost of contract creation; it is paid regardless.\\nHowever, the value of the transaction is not transferred to\\nthe aborted contract’s address when we are Out-of-Gas.\\nIf such an exception does not occur, then the remain-\\ning gas is refunded to the originator and the now-altered\\nstate is allowed to persist. Thus formally, we may specify\\nthe resultant state, gas and substate as (σ′, g′, A) where:\\ng′ ≡\\nif\\nσ∗∗= ∅\\ng∗∗\\nif\\ng∗∗< c ∧Hi < NH\\ng∗∗−c\\notherwise\\n(97)\\nσ′ ≡\\nσ\\nif\\nσ∗∗= ∅\\nσ∗∗\\nif\\ng∗∗< c ∧Hi < NH\\nσ∗∗\\nexcept:\\nσ′[a]c = KEC(o)\\notherwise\\n(98)\\nThe exception in the determination of σ′ dictates that\\no, the resultant byte sequence from the execution of the\\ninitialisation code, specifies the final body code for the\\nnewly-created account.\\nNote that the intention from block NH onwards (Home-\\nstead) is that the result is either a successfully created new\\ncontract with its endowment, or no new contract with no\\ntransfer of value. Before Homestead, if there is not enough\\ngas to pay c, an account at the new contract’s address is\\ncreated, along with all the initialisation side-effects, and\\nthe value is transferred, but no contract code is deployed.\\n7.1. Subtleties. Note that while the initialisation code\\nis executing, the newly created address exists but with no\\nintrinsic body code. Thus any message call received by\\nit during this time causes no code to be executed. If the\\ninitialisation execution ends with a SUICIDE instruction,\\nthe matter is moot since the account will be deleted before\\nthe transaction is completed. For a normal STOP code,\\nor if the code returned is otherwise empty, then the state\\nis left with a zombie account, and any remaining balance\\nwill be locked into the account forever.\\n8. Message Call\\nIn the case of executing a message call, several param-\\neters are required: sender (s), transaction originator (o),\\nrecipient (r), the account whose code is to be executed (c,\\nusually the same as recipient), available gas (g), value (v)\\nand gas price (p) together with an arbitrary length byte\\narray, d, the input data of the call and finally the present\\ndepth of the message-call/contract-creation stack (e).\\nAside from evaluating to a new state and transaction\\nsubstate, message calls also have an extra component-the\\noutput data denoted by the byte array o. This is ignored\\nwhen executing transactions, however message calls can\\nbe initiated due to VM-code execution and in this case\\nthis information is used.\\n(99)\\n(σ′, g′, A, o) ≡Θ(σ, s, o, r, c, g, p, v, ˜v, d, e)\\nNote that we need to differentiate between the value that\\nis to be transferred, v, from the value apparent in the ex-\\necution context, ˜v, for the DELEGATECALL instruction.\\nWe define σ1, the first transitional state as the orig-\\ninal state but with the value transferred from sender to\\nrecipient:\\n(100)\\nσ1[r]b ≡σ[r]b + v\\n∧\\nσ1[s]b ≡σ[s]b −v\\nETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER\\nEIP-150 REVISION\\nThroughout the present work, it is assumed that if\\nσ1[r] was originally undefined, it will be created as an ac-\\ncount with no code or state and zero balance and nonce.\\nThus the previous equation should be taken to mean:\\n(101)\\nσ1 ≡σ′\\nexcept:\\n(102)\\nσ1[s]b ≡σ′\\n1[s]b −v\\n(103)\\nand\\nσ′\\n1 ≡σ\\nexcept:\\n(104)\\n(\\nσ′\\n1[r] ≡(v, 0, KEC(()), TRIE(∅))\\nif\\nσ[r] = ∅\\nσ′\\n1[r]b ≡σ[r]b + v\\notherwise\\nThe account’s associated code (identified as the frag-\\nment whose Keccak hash is σ[c]c) is executed according to\\nthe execution model (see section 9). Just as with contract\\ncreation, if the execution halts in an exceptional fashion\\n(i.e. due to an exhausted gas supply, stack underflow, in-\\nvalid jump destination or invalid instruction), then no gas\\nis refunded to the caller and the state is reverted to the\\npoint immediately prior to balance transfer (i.e. σ).\\nσ′\\n≡\\n(\\nσ\\nif\\nσ∗∗= ∅\\nσ∗∗\\notherwise\\n(105)\\n(σ∗∗, g′, s, o)\\n≡\\nΞECREC(σ1, g, I)\\nif\\nr = 1\\nΞSHA256(σ1, g, I)\\nif\\nr = 2\\nΞRIP160(σ1, g, I)\\nif\\nr = 3\\nΞID(σ1, g, I)\\nif\\nr = 4\\nΞ(σ1, g, I)\\notherwise\\n(106)\\nIa\\n≡\\nr\\n(107)\\nIo\\n≡\\no\\n(108)\\nIp\\n≡\\np\\n(109)\\nId\\n≡\\nd\\n(110)\\nIs\\n≡\\ns\\n(111)\\nIv\\n≡\\n˜v\\n(112)\\nIe\\n≡\\ne\\n(113)\\nLet KEC(Ib)\\n=\\nσ[c]c\\n(114)\\nIt is assumed that the client will have stored the pair\\n(KEC(Ib), Ib) at some point prior in order to make the de-\\ntermination of Ib feasible.\\nAs can be seen, there are four exceptions to the usage\\nof the general execution framework Ξ for evaluation of the\\nmessage call: these are four so-called ‘precompiled’ con-\\ntracts, meant as a preliminary piece of architecture that\\nmay later become native extensions. The four contracts\\nin addresses 1, 2, 3 and 4 execute the elliptic curve public\\nkey recovery function, the SHA2 256-bit hash scheme, the\\nRIPEMD 160-bit hash scheme and the identity function\\nrespectively.\\nTheir full formal definition is in Appendix E.\\n9. Execution Model\\nThe execution model specifies how the system state is\\naltered given a series of bytecode instructions and a small\\ntuple of environmental data. This is specified through a\\nformal model of a virtual state machine, known as the\\nEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is a quasi-Turing-\\ncomplete machine; the quasi qualification comes from the\\nfact that the computation is intrinsically bounded through\\na parameter, gas, which limits the total amount of com-\\nputation done.\\n9.1. Basics. The EVM is a simple stack-based architec-\\nture. The word size of the machine (and thus size of stack\\nitem) is 256-bit. This was chosen to facilitate the Keccak-\\n256 hash scheme and elliptic-curve computations.\\nThe\\nmemory model is a simple word-addressed byte array. The\\nstack has a maximum size of 1024. The machine also has\\nan independent storage model; this is similar in concept\\nto the memory but rather than a byte array, it is a word-\\naddressable word array. Unlike memory, which is volatile,\\nstorage is non volatile and is maintained as part of the\\nsystem state. All locations in both storage and memory\\nare well-defined initially as zero.\\nThe machine does not follow the standard von Neu-\\nmann architecture. Rather than storing program code in\\ngenerally-accessible memory or storage, it is stored sepa-\\nrately in a virtual ROM interactable only through a spe-\\ncialised instruction.\\nThe machine can have exceptional execution for sev-\\neral reasons, including stack underflows and invalid in-\\nstructions.\\nLike the out-of-gas (OOG) exception, they\\ndo not leave state changes intact. Rather, the machine\\nhalts immediately and reports the issue to the execution\\nagent (either the transaction processor or, recursively, the\\nspawning execution environment) which will deal with it\\nseparately.\\n9.2. Fees\\nOverview. Fees (denominated in gas) are\\ncharged under three distinct circumstances, all three as\\nprerequisite to the execution of an operation. The first\\nand most common is the fee intrinsic to the computation\\nof the operation (see Appendix G).\\nSecondly, gas may\\nbe deducted in order to form the payment for a subor-\\ndinate message call or contract creation; this forms part\\nof the payment for CREATE, CALL and CALLCODE. Fi-\\nnally, gas may be paid due to an increase in the usage of\\nthe memory.\\nOver an account’s execution, the total fee for memory-\\nusage payable is proportional to smallest multiple of 32\\nbytes that are required such that all memory indices\\n(whether for read or write) are included in the range. This\\nis paid for on a just-in-time basis; as such, referencing an\\narea of memory at least 32 bytes greater than any previ-\\nously indexed memory will certainly result in an additional\\nmemory usage fee. Due to this fee it is highly unlikely\\naddresses will ever go above 32-bit bounds.\\nThat said,\\nimplementations must be able to manage this eventuality.\\nStorage fees have a slightly nuanced behaviour-to in-\\ncentivise minimisation of the use of storage (which corre-\\nsponds directly to a larger state database on all nodes),\\nthe execution fee for an operation that clears an entry in\\nthe storage is not only waived, a qualified refund is given;\\nin fact, this refund is effectively paid up-front since the\\ninitial usage of a storage location costs substantially more\\nthan normal usage.\\nSee Appendix H for a rigorous definition of the EVM\\ngas cost.\\n9.3. Execution Environment. In addition to the sys-\\ntem state σ, and the remaining gas for computation g,\\nthere are several pieces of important information used in\\nETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER\\nEIP-150 REVISION\\nthe execution environment that the execution agent must\\nprovide; these are contained in the tuple I:\\n• Ia, the address of the account which owns the\\ncode that is executing.\\n• Io, the sender address of the transaction that orig-\\ninated this execution.\\n• Ip, the price of gas in the transaction that origi-\\nnated this execution.\\n• Id, the byte array that is the input data to this\\nexecution; if the execution agent is a transaction,\\nthis would be the transaction data.\\n• Is, the address of the account which caused the\\ncode to be executing; if the execution agent is a\\ntransaction, this would be the transaction sender.\\n• Iv, the value, in Wei, passed to this account as\\npart of the same procedure as execution; if the\\nexecution agent is a transaction, this would be\\nthe transaction value.\\n• Ib, the byte array that is the machine code to be\\nexecuted.\\n• IH, the block header of the present block.\\n• Ie, the depth of the present message-call or\\ncontract-creation (i.e.\\nthe number of CALLs or\\nCREATEs being executed at present).\\nThe execution model defines the function Ξ, which can\\ncompute the resultant state σ′, the remaining gas g′, the\\nsuicide list s, the log series l, the refunds r and the resul-\\ntant output, o, given these definitions:\\n(115)\\n(σ′, g′, s, l, r, o) ≡Ξ(σ, g, I)\\n9.4. Execution Overview. We must now define the Ξ\\nfunction. In most practical implementations this will be\\nmodelled as an iterative progression of the pair comprising\\nthe full system state, σ and the machine state, µ. For-\\nmally, we define it recursively with a function X. This\\nuses an iterator function O (which defines the result of a\\nsingle cycle of the state machine) together with functions\\nZ which determines if the present state is an exceptional\\nhalting state of the machine and H, specifying the output\\ndata of the instruction if and only if the present state is a\\nnormal halting state of the machine.\\nThe empty sequence, denoted (), is not equal to the\\nempty set, denoted ∅; this is important when interpreting\\nthe output of H, which evaluates to ∅when execution is to\\ncontinue but a series (potentially empty) when execution\\nshould halt.\\nΞ(σ, g, I)\\n≡\\nX0,1,2,4\\n(σ, µ, A0, I)\\n(116)\\nµg\\n≡\\ng\\n(117)\\nµpc\\n≡\\n(118)\\nµm\\n≡\\n(0, 0, ...)\\n(119)\\nµi\\n≡\\n(120)\\nµs\\n≡\\n()\\n(121)\\n(122)\\nX\\n(σ, µ, A, I)\\n≡\\n∅, µ, A0, I, ()\\nif\\nZ(σ, µ, I)\\nO(σ, µ, A, I) · o\\nif\\no ̸= ∅\\nX\\nO(σ, µ, A, I)\\notherwise\\nwhere\\no\\n≡\\nH(µ, I)\\n(123)\\n(a, b, c) · d\\n≡\\n(a, b, c, d)\\n(124)\\nNote that we must drop the fourth value in the tuple\\nreturned by X to correctly evaluate Ξ, hence the subscript\\nX0,1,2,4.\\nX is thus cycled (recursively here, but implementations\\nare generally expected to use a simple iterative loop) until\\neither Z becomes true indicating that the present state is\\nexceptional and that the machine must be halted and any\\nchanges discarded or until H becomes a series (rather than\\nthe empty set) indicating that the machine has reached a\\ncontrolled halt.\\n9.4.1. Machine State. The machine state µ is defined as\\nthe tuple (g, pc, m, i, s) which are the gas available, the\\nprogram counter pc ∈P256 , the memory contents, the ac-\\ntive number of words in memory (counting continuously\\nfrom position 0), and the stack contents.\\nThe memory\\ncontents µm are a series of zeroes of size 2256.\\nFor the ease of reading, the instruction mnemonics,\\nwritten in small-caps (e.g. ADD), should be interpreted\\nas their numeric equivalents; the full table of instructions\\nand their specifics is given in Appendix H.\\nFor the purposes of defining Z, H and O, we define w\\nas the current operation to be executed:\\n(125)\\nw ≡\\n(\\nIb[µpc]\\nif\\nµpc < ∥Ib∥\\nSTOP\\notherwise\\nWe also assume the fixed amounts of δ and α, specify-\\ning the stack items removed and added, both subscript-\\nable on the instruction and an instruction cost function C\\nevaluating to the full cost, in gas, of executing the given\\ninstruction.\\n9.4.2. Exceptional Halting. The exceptional halting func-\\ntion Z is defined as:\\n(126)\\nZ(σ, µ, I) ≡\\nµg < C(σ, µ, I)\\n∨\\nδw = ∅\\n∨\\n∥µs∥< δw\\n∨\\n(w ∈{JUMP, JUMPI}\\n∧\\nµs[0] /∈D(Ib))\\n∨\\n∥µs∥−δw + αw > 1024\\nThis states that the execution is in an exceptional halt-\\ning state if there is insufficient gas, if the instruction is in-\\nvalid (and therefore its δ subscript is undefined), if there\\nare insufficient stack items, if a JUMP/JUMPI destination\\nis invalid or the new stack size would be larger then 1024.\\nThe astute reader will realise that this implies that no in-\\nstruction can, through its execution, cause an exceptional\\nhalt.\\n9.4.3. Jump Destination Validity. We previously used D\\nas the function to determine the set of valid jump desti-\\nnations given the code that is being run. We define this\\nas any position in the code occupied by a JUMPDEST in-\\nstruction.\\nAll such positions must be on valid instruction bound-\\naries, rather than sitting in the data portion of PUSH\\noperations and must appear within the explicitly defined\\nportion of the code (rather than in the implicitly defined\\nSTOP operations that trail it).\\nFormally:\\n(127)\\nD(c) ≡DJ(c, 0)\\nETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER\\nEIP-150 REVISION\\nwhere:\\n(128)\\nDJ(c, i) ≡\\n{}\\nif\\ni ⩾|c|\\n{i} ∪DJ(c, N(i, c[i]))\\nif\\nc[i] = JUMPDEST\\nDJ(c, N(i, c[i]))\\notherwise\\nwhere N is the next valid instruction position in the\\ncode, skipping the data of a PUSH instruction, if any:\\n(129)\\nN(i, w) ≡\\n(\\ni + w −PUSH1 + 2\\nif\\nw ∈[PUSH1, PUSH32]\\ni + 1\\notherwise\\n9.4.4. Normal Halting. The normal halting function H is\\ndefined:\\n(130)\\nH(µ, I) ≡\\nHRETURN(µ)\\nif\\nw = RETURN\\n()\\nif\\nw ∈{STOP, SUICIDE}\\n∅\\notherwise\\nThe data-returning halt operation, RETURN, has a\\nspecial function HRETURN, defined in Appendix H.\\n9.5. The Execution Cycle. Stack items are added or\\nremoved from the left-most, lower-indexed portion of the\\nseries; all other items remain unchanged:\\nO\\n(σ, µ, A, I)\\n≡\\n(σ′, µ′, A′, I)\\n(131)\\n∆\\n≡\\nαw −δw\\n(132)\\n∥µ′\\ns∥\\n≡\\n∥µs∥+ ∆\\n(133)\\n∀x ∈[αw, ∥µ′\\ns∥) : µ′\\ns[x]\\n≡\\nµs[x + ∆]\\n(134)\\nThe gas is reduced by the instruction’s gas cost and\\nfor most instructions, the program counter increments on\\neach cycle, for the three exceptions, we assume a function\\nJ, subscripted by one of two instructions, which evaluates\\nto the according value:\\nµ′\\ng\\n≡\\nµg −C(σ, µ, I)\\n(135)\\nµ′\\npc\\n≡\\nJJUMP(µ)\\nif\\nw = JUMP\\nJJUMPI(µ)\\nif\\nw = JUMPI\\nN(µpc, w)\\notherwise\\n(136)\\nIn general, we assume the memory, suicide list and sys-\\ntem state don’t change:\\nµ′\\nm\\n≡\\nµm\\n(137)\\nµ′\\ni\\n≡\\nµi\\n(138)\\nA′\\n≡\\nA\\n(139)\\nσ′\\n≡\\nσ\\n(140)\\nHowever, instructions do typically alter one or several\\ncomponents of these values. Altered components listed by\\ninstruction are noted in Appendix H, alongside values for\\nα and δ and a formal description of the gas requirements.\\n10. Blocktree to Blockchain\\nThe canonical blockchain is a path from root to leaf\\nthrough the entire block tree. In order to have consensus\\nover which path it is, conceptually we identify the path\\nthat has had the most computation done upon it, or, the\\nheaviest path. Clearly one factor that helps determine the\\nheaviest path is the block number of the leaf, equivalent\\nto the number of blocks, not counting the unmined genesis\\nblock, in the path. The longer the path, the greater the\\ntotal mining effort that must have been done in order to\\narrive at the leaf. This is akin to existing schemes, such\\nas that employed in Bitcoin-derived protocols.\\nSince a block header includes the difficulty, the header\\nalone is enough to validate the computation done. Any\\nblock contributes toward the total computation or total\\ndifficulty of a chain.\\nThus we define the total difficulty of block B recur-\\nsively as:\\nBt\\n≡\\nB′\\nt + Bd\\n(141)\\nB′\\n≡\\nP(BH)\\n(142)\\nAs such given a block B, Bt is its total difficulty, B′ is\\nits parent block and Bd is its difficulty.\\n11. Block Finalisation\\nThe process of finalising a block involves four stages:\\n(1) Validate (or, if mining, determine) ommers;\\n(2) validate (or, if mining, determine) transactions;\\n(3) apply rewards;\\n(4) verify (or, if mining, compute a valid) state and\\nnonce.\\n11.1. Ommer\\nValidation. The validation of ommer\\nheaders means nothing more than verifying that each om-\\nmer header is both a valid header and satisfies the rela-\\ntion of Nth-generation ommer to the present block where\\nN ≤6. The maximum of ommer headers is two. Formally:\\n(143)\\n∥BU∥⩽2\\n^\\nU∈BU\\nV (U) ∧k(U, P(BH)H, 6)\\nwhere k denotes the “is-kin” property:\\n(144)\\nk(U, H, n) ≡\\nfalse\\nif\\nn = 0\\ns(U, H)\\n∨k(U, P(H)H, n −1)\\notherwise\\nand s denotes the “is-sibling” property:\\n(145)\\ns(U, H) ≡(P(H) = P(U) ∧H ̸= U ∧U /∈B(H)U)\\nwhere B(H) is the block of the corresponding header H.\\n11.2. Transaction\\nValidation. The\\ngiven\\ngasUsed\\nmust correspond faithfully to the transactions listed: BH g,\\nthe total gas used in the block, must be equal to the ac-\\ncumulated gas used according to the final transaction:\\n(146)\\nBH g = ℓ(R)u\\n11.3. Reward Application. The application of rewards\\nto a block involves raising the balance of the accounts of\\nthe beneficiary address of the block and each ommer by a\\ncertain amount. We raise the block’s beneficiary account\\nby Rb; for each ommer, we raise the block’s beneficiary by\\nan additional\\n32 of the block reward and the beneficiary of\\nthe ommer gets rewarded depending on the block number.\\nFormally we define the function Ω:\\nΩ(B, σ)\\n≡\\nσ′ : σ′ = σ\\nexcept:\\n(147)\\nσ′[BH c]b\\n=\\nσ[BH c]b + (1 + ∥BU∥\\n)Rb\\n(148)\\n∀U∈BU :\\n(149)\\nσ′[Uc]b\\n=\\nσ[Uc]b + (1 + 1\\n8(Ui −BH i))Rb\\nIf there are collisions of the beneficiary addresses be-\\ntween ommers and the block (i.e. two ommers with the\\nETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER\\nEIP-150 REVISION\\nsame beneficiary address or an ommer with the same bene-\\nficiary address as the present block), additions are applied\\ncumulatively.\\nWe define the block reward as 5 Ether:\\n(150)\\nLet\\nRb = 5 × 1018\\n11.4. State & Nonce Validation. We may now define\\nthe function, Γ, that maps a block B to its initiation state:\\n(151)\\nΓ(B) ≡\\n(\\nσ0\\nif\\nP(BH) = ∅\\nσi : TRIE(LS(σi)) = P(BH)H r\\notherwise\\nHere, TRIE(LS(σi)) means the hash of the root node of\\na trie of state σi; it is assumed that implementations will\\nstore this in the state database, trivial and efficient since\\nthe trie is by nature an immutable data structure.\\nAnd finally define Φ, the block transition function,\\nwhich maps an incomplete block B to a complete block\\nB′:\\nΦ(B)\\n≡\\nB′ :\\nB′ = B∗\\nexcept:\\n(152)\\nB′\\nn\\n=\\nn :\\nx ⩽2256\\nHd\\n(153)\\nB′\\nm\\n=\\nm\\nwith (x, m) = PoW(B∗n, n, d)\\n(154)\\nB∗\\n≡\\nB\\nexcept:\\nB∗\\nr = r(Π(Γ(B), B))\\n(155)\\nWith d being a dataset as specified in appendix J.\\nAs specified at the beginning of the present work, Π is\\nthe state-transition function, which is defined in terms of\\nΩ, the block finalisation function and Υ, the transaction-\\nevaluation function, both now well-defined.\\nAs previously detailed, R[n]σ, R[n]l and R[n]u are the\\nnth corresponding states, logs and cumulative gas used af-\\nter each transaction (R[n]b, the fourth component in the\\ntuple, has already been defined in terms of the logs). The\\nformer is defined simply as the state resulting from apply-\\ning the corresponding transaction to the state resulting\\nfrom the previous transaction (or the block’s initial state\\nin the case of the first such transaction):\\n(156)\\nR[n]σ =\\n(\\nΓ(B)\\nif\\nn < 0\\nΥ(R[n −1]σ, BT[n])\\notherwise\\nIn the case of BR[n]u, we take a similar approach defin-\\ning each item as the gas used in evaluating the correspond-\\ning transaction summed with the previous item (or zero,\\nif it is the first), giving us a running total:\\n(157)\\nR[n]u =\\nif\\nn < 0\\nΥg(R[n −1]σ, BT[n])\\n+R[n −1]u\\notherwise\\nFor R[n]l, we utilise the Υl function that we conve-\\nniently defined in the transaction execution function.\\n(158)\\nR[n]l = Υl(R[n −1]σ, BT[n])\\nFinally, we define Π as the new state given the block\\nreward function Ωapplied to the final transaction’s resul-\\ntant state, ℓ(BR)σ:\\n(159)\\nΠ(σ, B) ≡Ω(B, ℓ(R)σ)\\nThus the complete block-transition mechanism, less\\nPoW, the proof-of-work function is defined.\\n11.5. Mining\\nProof-of-Work. The mining proof-of-\\nwork (PoW) exists as a cryptographically secure nonce\\nthat proves beyond reasonable doubt that a particular\\namount of computation has been expended in the deter-\\nmination of some token value n. It is utilised to enforce\\nthe blockchain security by giving meaning and credence\\nto the notion of difficulty (and, by extension, total dif-\\nficulty).\\nHowever, since mining new blocks comes with\\nan attached reward, the proof-of-work not only functions\\nas a method of securing confidence that the blockchain\\nwill remain canonical into the future, but also as a wealth\\ndistribution mechanism.\\nFor both reasons, there are two important goals of the\\nproof-of-work function; firstly, it should be as accessible as\\npossible to as many people as possible. The requirement\\nof, or reward from, specialised and uncommon hardware\\nshould be minimised. This makes the distribution model\\nas open as possible, and, ideally, makes the act of mining a\\nsimple swap from electricity to Ether at roughly the same\\nrate for anyone around the world.\\nSecondly, it should not be possible to make super-linear\\nprofits, and especially not so with a high initial barrier.\\nSuch a mechanism allows a well-funded adversary to gain\\na troublesome amount of the network’s total mining power\\nand as such gives them a super-linear reward (thus skew-\\ning distribution in their favour) as well as reducing the\\nnetwork security.\\nOne plague of the Bitcoin world is ASICs. These are\\nspecialised pieces of compute hardware that exist only to\\ndo a single task. In Bitcoin’s case the task is the SHA256\\nhash function. While ASICs exist for a proof-of-work func-\\ntion, both goals are placed in jeopardy. Because of this,\\na proof-of-work function that is ASIC-resistant (i.e. diffi-\\ncult or economically inefficient to implement in specialised\\ncompute hardware) has been identified as the proverbial\\nsilver bullet.\\nTwo directions exist for ASIC resistance; firstly make\\nit sequential memory-hard, i.e. engineer the function such\\nthat the determination of the nonce requires a lot of mem-\\nory and bandwidth such that the memory cannot be used\\nin parallel to discover multiple nonces simultaneously. The\\nsecond is to make the type of computation it would need\\nto do general-purpose; the meaning of “specialised hard-\\nware” for a general-purpose task set is, naturally, general\\npurpose hardware and as such commodity desktop com-\\nputers are likely to be pretty close to “specialised hard-\\nware” for the task. For Ethereum 1.0 we have chosen the\\nfirst path.\\nMore formally, the proof-of-work function takes the\\nform of PoW:\\n(160)\\nm = Hm\\n∧\\nn ⩽2256\\nHd\\nwith\\n(m, n) = PoW(Hn, Hn, d)\\nWhere Hn is the new block’s header but without the\\nnonce and mix-hash components; Hn is the nonce of the\\nheader; d is a large data set needed to compute the mix-\\nHash and Hd is the new block’s difficulty value (i.e. the\\nblock difficulty from section 10). PoW is the proof-of-work\\nfunction which evaluates to an array with the first item\\nbeing the mixHash and the second item being a pseudo-\\nrandom number cryptographically dependent on H and d.\\nThe underlying algorithm is called Ethash and is described\\nbelow.\\nETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER\\nEIP-150 REVISION\\n11.5.1. Ethash. Ethash is the planned PoW algorithm\\nfor Ethereum 1.0.\\nIt is the latest version of Dagger-\\nHashimoto, introduced by Buterin [2013b] and Dryja\\n[2014], although it can no longer appropriately be called\\nthat since many of the original features of both algorithms\\nhave been drastically changed in the last month of research\\nand development. The general route that the algorithm\\ntakes is as follows:\\nThere exists a seed which can be computed for each\\nblock by scanning through the block headers up until that\\npoint. From the seed, one can compute a pseudorandom\\ncache, Jcacheinit bytes in initial size. Light clients store\\nthe cache.\\nFrom the cache, we can generate a dataset,\\nJdatasetinit bytes in initial size, with the property that\\neach item in the dataset depends on only a small number\\nof items from the cache. Full clients and miners store the\\ndataset. The dataset grows linearly with time.\\nMining involves grabbing random slices of the dataset\\nand hashing them together. Verification can be done with\\nlow memory by using the cache to regenerate the specific\\npieces of the dataset that you need, so you only need to\\nstore the cache.\\nThe large dataset is updated once ev-\\nery Jepoch blocks, so the vast majority of a miner’s effort\\nwill be reading the dataset, not making changes to it. The\\nmentioned parameters as well as the algorithm is explained\\nin detail in appendix J.\\n12. Implementing Contracts\\nThere are several patterns of contracts engineering that\\nallow particular useful behaviours; two of these that I will\\nbriefly discuss are data feeds and random numbers.\\n12.1. Data Feeds. A data feed contract is one which pro-\\nvides a single service: it gives access to information from\\nthe external world within Ethereum. The accuracy and\\ntimeliness of this information is not guaranteed and it is\\nthe task of a secondary contract author-the contract that\\nutilises the data feed-to determine how much trust can\\nbe placed in any single data feed.\\nThe general pattern involves a single contract within\\nEthereum which, when given a message call, replies with\\nsome timely information concerning an external phenom-\\nenon.\\nAn example might be the local temperature of\\nNew York City. This would be implemented as a contract\\nthat returned that value of some known point in storage.\\nOf course this point in storage must be maintained with\\nthe correct such temperature, and thus the second part\\nof the pattern would be for an external server to run an\\nEthereum node, and immediately on discovery of a new\\nblock, creates a new valid transaction, sent to the contract,\\nupdating said value in storage. The contract’s code would\\naccept such updates only from the identity contained on\\nsaid server.\\n12.2. Random Numbers. Providing random numbers\\nwithin a deterministic system is, naturally, an impossible\\ntask. However, we can approximate with pseudo-random\\nnumbers by utilising data which is generally unknowable\\nat the time of transacting. Such data might include the\\nblock’s hash, the block’s timestamp and the block’s benefi-\\nciary address. In order to make it hard for malicious miner\\nto control those values, one should use the BLOCKHASH\\noperation in order to use hashes of the previous 256 blocks\\nas pseudo-random numbers. For a series of such numbers,\\na trivial solution would be to add some constant amount\\nand hashing the result.\\n13. Future Directions\\nThe state database won’t be forced to maintain all past\\nstate trie structures into the future. It should maintain an\\nage for each node and eventually discard nodes that are\\nneither recent enough nor checkpoints; checkpoints, or a\\nset of nodes in the database that allow a particular block’s\\nstate trie to be traversed, could be used to place a maxi-\\nmum limit on the amount of computation needed in order\\nto retrieve any state throughout the blockchain.\\nBlockchain consolidation could be used in order to re-\\nduce the amount of blocks a client would need to download\\nto act as a full, mining, node. A compressed archive of the\\ntrie structure at given points in time (perhaps one in every\\n10,000th block) could be maintained by the peer network,\\neffectively recasting the genesis block. This would reduce\\nthe amount to be downloaded to a single archive plus a\\nhard maximum limit of blocks.\\nFinally, blockchain compression could perhaps be con-\\nducted: nodes in state trie that haven’t sent/received a\\ntransaction in some constant amount of blocks could be\\nthrown out, reducing both Ether-leakage and the growth\\nof the state database.\\n13.1. Scalability. Scalability remains an eternal con-\\ncern. With a generalised state transition function, it be-\\ncomes difficult to partition and parallelise transactions\\nto apply the divide-and-conquer strategy. Unaddressed,\\nthe dynamic value-range of the system remains essentially\\nfixed and as the average transaction value increases, the\\nless valuable of them become ignored, being economically\\npointless to include in the main ledger. However, several\\nstrategies exist that may potentially be exploited to pro-\\nvide a considerably more scalable protocol.\\nSome form of hierarchical structure, achieved by ei-\\nther consolidating smaller lighter-weight chains into the\\nmain block or building the main block through the in-\\ncremental combination and adhesion (through proof-of-\\nwork) of smaller transaction sets may allow parallelisa-\\ntion of transaction combination and block-building. Par-\\nallelism could also come from a prioritised set of parallel\\nblockchains, consolidated each block and with duplicate\\nor invalid transactions thrown out accordingly.\\nFinally, verifiable computation, if made generally avail-\\nable and efficient enough, may provide a route to allow the\\nproof-of-work to be the verification of final state.\\n14. Conclusion\\nI have introduced, discussed and formally defined the\\nprotocol of Ethereum. Through this protocol the reader\\nmay implement a node on the Ethereum network and join\\nothers in a decentralised secure social operating system.\\nContracts may be authored in order to algorithmically\\nspecify and autonomously enforce rules of interaction.\\n15.

Terminology\\nExternal Actor: A person or other entity able to interface to an Ethereum node, but external to the world of\\nEthereum. It can interact with Ethereum through depositing signed Transactions and inspecting the blockchain\\nand associated state. Has one (or more) intrinsic Accounts.\\nAddress: A 160-bit code used for identifying Accounts.\\nAccount: Accounts have an intrinsic balance and transaction count maintained as part of the Ethereum state.\\nThey also have some (possibly empty) EVM Code and a (possibly empty) Storage State associated with them.\\nThough homogenous, it makes sense to distinguish between two practical types of account: those with empty\\nassociated EVM Code (thus the account balance is controlled, if at all, by some external entity) and those with\\nnon-empty associated EVM Code (thus the account represents an Autonomous Object). Each Account has a\\nsingle Address that identifies it.\\nTransaction: A piece of data, signed by an External Actor. It represents either a Message or a new Autonomous\\nObject. Transactions are recorded into each block of the blockchain.\\nAutonomous Object: A notional object existent only within the hypothetical state of Ethereum. Has an intrinsic\\naddress and thus an associated account; the account will have non-empty associated EVM Code. Incorporated\\nonly as the Storage State of that account.\\nStorage State: The information particular to a given Account that is maintained between the times that the\\nAccount’s associated EVM Code runs.\\nMessage: Data (as a set of bytes) and Value (specified as Ether) that is passed between two Accounts, either\\nthrough the deterministic operation of an Autonomous Object or the cryptographically secure signature of the\\nTransaction.\\nMessage Call: The act of passing a message from one Account to another. If the destination account is associated\\nwith non-empty EVM Code, then the VM will be started with the state of said Object and the Message acted\\nupon. If the message sender is an Autonomous Object, then the Call passes any data returned from the VM\\noperation.\\nGas: The fundamental network cost unit. Paid for exclusively by Ether (as of PoC-4), which is converted freely\\nto and from Gas as required. Gas does not exist outside of the internal Ethereum computation engine; its price\\nis set by the Transaction and miners are free to ignore Transactions whose Gas price is too low.\\nContract: Informal term used to mean both a piece of EVM Code that may be associated with an Account or an\\nAutonomous Object.\\nObject: Synonym for Autonomous Object.\\nETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER\\nEIP-150 REVISION\\nApp: An end-user-visible application hosted in the Ethereum Browser.\\nEthereum Browser: (aka Ethereum Reference Client) A cross-platform GUI of an interface similar to a simplified\\nbrowser (a la Chrome) that is able to host sandboxed applications whose backend is purely on the Ethereum\\nprotocol.\\nEthereum Virtual Machine: (aka EVM) The virtual machine that forms the key part of the execution model\\nfor an Account’s associated EVM Code.\\nEthereum Runtime Environment: (aka ERE) The environment which is provided to an Autonomous Object\\nexecuting in the EVM. Includes the EVM but also the structure of the world state on which the EVM relies for\\ncertain I/O instructions including CALL & CREATE.\\nEVM Code: The bytecode that the EVM can natively execute.

Recursive Length Prefix\\nThis is a serialisation method for encoding arbitrarily structured binary data (byte arrays).\\nWe define the set of possible structures T:\\nT\\n≡\\nL ∪B\\n(161)\\nL\\n≡\\n{t : t = (t[0], t[1], ...) ∧∀n<∥t∥t[n] ∈T}\\n(162)\\nB\\n≡\\n{b : b = (b[0], b[1], ...) ∧∀n<∥b∥b[n] ∈O}\\n(163)\\nWhere O is the set of bytes. Thus B is the set of all sequences of bytes (otherwise known as byte-arrays, and a leaf if\\nimagined as a tree), L is the set of all tree-like (sub-)structures that are not a single leaf (a branch node if imagined as\\na tree) and T is the set of all byte-arrays and such structural sequences.\\nWe define the RLP function as RLP through two sub-functions, the first handling the instance when the value is a\\nbyte array, the second when it is a sequence of further values:\\n(164)\\nRLP(x) ≡\\n(\\nRb(x)\\nif\\nx ∈B\\nRl(x)\\notherwise\\nIf the value to be serialised is a byte-array, the RLP serialisation takes one of three forms:\\n• If the byte-array contains solely a single byte and that single byte is less than 128, then the input is exactly\\nequal to the output.\\n• If the byte-array contains fewer than 56 bytes, then the output is equal to the input prefixed by the byte equal\\nto the length of the byte array plus 128.\\n• Otherwise, the output is equal to the input prefixed by the minimal-length byte-array which when interpreted\\nas a big-endian integer is equal to the length of the input byte array, which is itself prefixed by the number of\\nbytes required to faithfully encode this length value plus 183.\\nFormally, we define Rb:\\nRb(x)\\n≡\\nx\\nif\\n∥x∥= 1 ∧x[0] < 128\\n(128 + ∥x∥) · x\\nelse if\\n∥x∥< 56\\n183 +\\nBE(∥x∥)\\n· BE(∥x∥) · x\\notherwise\\n(165)\\nBE(x)\\n≡\\n(b0, b1, ...) : b0 ̸= 0 ∧x =\\nn<∥b∥\\nX\\nn=0\\nbn · 256∥b∥−1−n\\n(166)\\n(a) · (b, c) · (d, e)\\n=\\n(a, b, c, d, e)\\n(167)\\nThus BE is the function that expands a positive integer value to a big-endian byte array of minimal length and the\\ndot operator performs sequence concatenation.\\nIf instead, the value to be serialised is a sequence of other items then the RLP serialisation takes one of two forms:\\n• If the concatenated serialisations of each contained item is less than 56 bytes in length, then the output is equal\\nto that concatenation prefixed by the byte equal to the length of this byte array plus 192.\\n• Otherwise, the output is equal to the concatenated serialisations prefixed by the minimal-length byte-array\\nwhich when interpreted as a big-endian integer is equal to the length of the concatenated serialisations byte\\narray, which is itself prefixed by the number of bytes required to faithfully encode this length value plus 247.\\nThus we finish by formally defining Rl:\\nRl(x)\\n≡\\n(\\n(192 + ∥s(x)∥) · s(x)\\nif\\n∥s(x)∥< 56\\n247 +\\nBE(∥s(x)∥)\\n· BE(∥s(x)∥) · s(x)\\notherwise\\n(168)\\ns(x)\\n≡\\nRLP(x0) · RLP(x1)...\\n(169)\\nETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER\\nEIP-150 REVISION\\nIf RLP is used to encode a scalar, defined only as a positive integer (P or any x for Px), it must be specified as the\\nshortest byte array such that the big-endian interpretation of it is equal. Thus the RLP of some positive integer i is\\ndefined as:\\n(170)\\nRLP(i : i ∈P) ≡RLP(BE(i))\\nWhen interpreting RLP data, if an expected fragment is decoded as a scalar and leading zeroes are found in the byte\\nsequence, clients are required to consider it non-canonical and treat it in the same manner as otherwise invalid RLP\\ndata, dismissing it completely.\\nThere is no specific canonical encoding format for signed or floating-point values.\\nAppendix C. Hex-Prefix Encoding\\nHex-prefix encoding is an efficient method of encoding an arbitrary number of nibbles as a byte array. It is able to\\nstore an additional flag which, when used in the context of the trie (the only context in which it is used), disambiguates\\nbetween node types.\\nIt is defined as the function HP which maps from a sequence of nibbles (represented by the set Y) together with a\\nboolean value to a sequence of bytes (represented by the set B):\\nHP(x, t) : x ∈Y\\n≡\\n(\\n(16f(t), 16x[0] + x[1], 16x[2] + x[3], ...)\\nif\\n∥x∥is even\\n(16(f(t) + 1) + x[0], 16x[1] + x[2], 16x[3] + x[4], ...)\\notherwise\\n(171)\\nf(t)\\n≡\\n(\\nif\\nt ̸= 0\\notherwise\\n(172)\\nThus the high nibble of the first byte contains two flags; the lowest bit encoding the oddness of the length and the\\nsecond-lowest encoding the flag t. The low nibble of the first byte is zero in the case of an even number of nibbles and the\\nfirst nibble in the case of an odd number. All remaining nibbles (now an even number) fit properly into the remaining\\nbytes.\\nAppendix D. Modified Merkle Patricia Tree\\nThe modified Merkle Patricia tree (trie) provides a persistent data structure to map between arbitrary-length binary\\ndata (byte arrays). It is defined in terms of a mutable data structure to map between 256-bit binary fragments and\\narbitrary-length binary data, typically implemented as a database. The core of the trie, and its sole requirement in terms\\nof the protocol specification is to provide a single value that identifies a given set of key-value pairs, which may be either\\na 32 byte sequence or the empty byte sequence. It is left as an implementation consideration to store and maintain the\\nstructure of the trie in a manner the allows effective and efficient realisation of the protocol.\\nFormally, we assume the input value I, a set containing pairs of byte sequences:\\n(173)\\nI = {(k0 ∈B, v0 ∈B), (k1 ∈B, v1 ∈B), ...}\\nWhen considering such a sequence, we use the common numeric subscript notation to refer to a tuple’s key or value,\\nthus:\\n(174)\\n∀I∈II ≡(I0, I1)\\nAny series of bytes may also trivially be viewed as a series of nibbles, given an endian-specific notation; here we\\nassume big-endian. Thus:\\ny(I)\\n=\\n{(k′\\n0 ∈Y, v0 ∈B), (k′\\n1 ∈Y, v1 ∈B), ...}\\n(175)\\n∀n\\n∀i:i<2∥kn∥\\nk′\\nn[i]\\n≡\\n(\\n⌊kn[i ÷ 2] ÷ 16⌋\\nif i is even\\nkn[⌊i ÷ 2⌋] mod 16\\notherwise\\n(176)\\nWe define the function TRIE, which evaluates to the root of the trie that represents this set when encoded in this\\nstructure:\\n(177)\\nTRIE(I) ≡KEC(c(I, 0))\\nWe also assume a function n, the trie’s node cap function. When composing a node, we use RLP to encode the\\nstructure. As a means of reducing storage complexity, for nodes whose composed RLP is fewer than 32 bytes, we store\\nthe RLP directly; for those larger we assert prescience of the byte array whose Keccak hash evaluates to our reference.\\nThus we define in terms of c, the node composition function:\\n(178)\\nn(I, i) ≡\\n()\\nif\\nI = ∅\\nc(I, i)\\nif\\n∥c(I, i)∥< 32\\nKEC(c(I, i))\\notherwise\\nIn a manner similar to a radix tree, when the trie is traversed from root to leaf, one may build a single key-value\\npair. The key is accumulated through the traversal, acquiring a single nibble from each branch node (just as with a\\nradix tree). Unlike a radix tree, in the case of multiple keys sharing the same prefix or in the case of a single key having\\nETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER\\nEIP-150 REVISION\\na unique suffix, two optimising nodes are provided. Thus while traversing, one may potentially acquire multiple nibbles\\nfrom each of the other two node types, extension and leaf. There are three kinds of nodes in the trie:\\nLeaf: A two-item structure whose first item corresponds to the nibbles in the key not already accounted for by the\\naccumulation of keys and branches traversed from the root. The hex-prefix encoding method is used and the\\nsecond parameter to the function is required to be true.\\nExtension: A two-item structure whose first item corresponds to a series of nibbles of size greater than one that\\nare shared by at least two distinct keys past the accumulation of nibbles keys and branches as traversed from\\nthe root. The hex-prefix encoding method is used and the second parameter to the function is required to be\\nfalse.\\nBranch: A 17-item structure whose first sixteen items correspond to each of the sixteen possible nibble values for\\nthe keys at this point in their traversal. The 17th item is used in the case of this being a terminator node and\\nthus a key being ended at this point in its traversal.\\nA branch is then only used when necessary; no branch nodes may exist that contain only a single non-zero entry. We\\nmay formally define this structure with the structural composition function c:\\n(179)\\nc(I, i) ≡\\nRLP\\nHP(I0[i..(∥I0∥−1)], true), I1\\nif\\n∥I∥= 1\\nwhere ∃I : I ∈I\\nRLP\\nHP(I0[i..(j −1)], false), n(I, j)\\nif\\ni ̸= j\\nwhere j = arg maxx : ∃l : ∥l∥= x : ∀I∈I : I0[0..(x −1)] = l\\nRLP\\n(u(0), u(1), ..., u(15), v)\\notherwise\\nwhere u(j)\\n≡\\nn({I : I ∈I ∧I0[i] = j}, i + 1)\\nv\\n=\\n(\\nI1\\nif\\n∃I : I ∈I ∧∥I0∥= i\\n()\\notherwise\\nD.1. Trie Database. Thus no explicit assumptions are made concerning what data is stored and what is not, since\\nthat is an implementation-specific consideration; we simply define the identity function mapping the key-value set I\\nto a 32-byte hash and assert that only a single such hash exists for any I, which though not strictly true is accurate\\nwithin acceptable precision given the Keccak hash’s collision resistance. In reality, a sensible implementation will not\\nfully recompute the trie root hash for each set.\\nA reasonable implementation will maintain a database of nodes determined from the computation of various tries\\nor, more formally, it will memoise the function c. This strategy uses the nature of the trie to both easily recall the\\ncontents of any previous key-value set and to store multiple such sets in a very efficient manner. Due to the dependency\\nrelationship, Merkle-proofs may be constructed with an O(log N) space requirement that can demonstrate a particular\\nleaf must exist within a trie of a given root hash.\\nAppendix E. Precompiled Contracts\\nFor each precompiled contract, we make use of a template function, ΞPRE, which implements the out-of-gas checking.\\n(180)\\nΞPRE(σ, g, I) ≡\\n(\\n(∅, 0, A0, ())\\nif\\ng < gr\\n(σ, g −gr, A0, o)\\notherwise\\nThe precompiled contracts each use these definitions and provide specifications for the o (the output data) and gr,\\nthe gas requirements.\\nFor the elliptic curve DSA recover VM execution function, we also define d to be the input data, well-defined for an\\ninfinite length by appending zeroes as required.

Signing Transactions\\nThe method of signing transactions is similar to the ‘Electrum style signatures’; it utilises the SECP-256k1 curve as\\ndescribed by Gura et al. [2004].\\nIt is assumed that the sender has a valid private key pr, which is a randomly selected positive integer (represented as\\na byte array of length 32 in big-endian form) in the range [1, secp256k1n −1].\\nWe assert the functions ECDSASIGN, ECDSARESTORE and ECDSAPUBKEY. These are formally defined in the literature.\\nECDSAPUBKEY(pr ∈B32)\\n≡\\npu ∈B64\\n(206)\\nECDSASIGN(e ∈B32, pr ∈B32)\\n≡\\n(v ∈B1, r ∈B32, s ∈B32)\\n(207)\\nECDSARECOVER(e ∈B32, v ∈B1, r ∈B32, s ∈B32)\\n≡\\npu ∈B64\\n(208)\\nWhere pu is the public key, assumed to be a byte array of size 64 (formed from the concatenation of two positive\\nintegers each < 2256) and pr is the private key, a byte array of size 32 (or a single positive integer in the aforementioned\\nrange). It is assumed that v is the ‘recovery id’, a 1 byte value specifying the sign and finiteness of the curve point; this\\nvalue is in the range of [27, 30], however we declare the upper two possibilities, representing infinite values, invalid.\\nWe declare that a signature is invalid unless all the following conditions are true:\\n0 < r < secp256k1n\\n(209)\\n0 < s <\\nsecp256k1n\\nif\\nHi < NH\\nsecp256k1n ÷ 2\\notherwise\\n(210)\\nv ∈{27, 28}\\n(211)\\nwhere:\\nsecp256k1n = 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337\\n(212)\\nFor a given private key, pr, the Ethereum address A(pr) (a 160-bit value) to which it corresponds is defined as the\\nright most 160-bits of the Keccak hash of the corresponding ECDSA public key:\\n(213)\\nA(pr) = B96..255\\nKEC\\nECDSAPUBKEY(pr)\\nThe message hash, h(T), to be signed is the Keccak hash of the transaction without the latter three signature\\ncomponents, formally described as Tr, Ts and Tw:\\nLS(T)\\n≡\\n(\\n(Tn, Tp, Tg, Tt, Tv, Ti)\\nif Tt = 0\\n(Tn, Tp, Tg, Tt, Tv, Td)\\notherwise\\n(214)\\nh(T)\\n≡\\nKEC(LS(T))\\n(215)\\nThe signed transaction G(T, pr) is defined as:\\nG(T, pr) ≡T\\nexcept:\\n(216)\\n(Tw, Tr, Ts) = ECDSASIGN(h(T), pr)\\n(217)\\nETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER\\nEIP-150 REVISION\\nWe may then define the sender function S of the transaction as:\\n(218)\\nS(T) ≡B96..255\\nKEC\\nECDSARECOVER(h(T), Tw, Tr, Ts)\\nThe assertion that the sender of the a signed transaction equals the address of the signer should be self-evident:\\n(219)\\n∀T : ∀pr : S(G(T, pr)) ≡A(pr)\\nAppendix G.

KEC\\n(42)\\nrefers to the Keccak hash\\nof a byte array of length one whose first and only byte is of value 42, used for the nonce. KEC\\nRLP\\n()\\nvalue refers to\\nthe hash of the ommer lists in RLP, both empty lists.\\nThe proof-of-concept series include a development premine, making the state root hash some value stateRoot. Also\\ntime will be set to the intial timestamp of the genesis block. The latest documentation should be consulted for those\\nvalues.\\nAppendix J. Ethash\\nJ.1. Definitions. We employ the following definitions:\\nName\\nValue\\nDescription\\nJwordbytes\\nBytes in word.\\nJdatasetinit\\nBytes in dataset at genesis.\\nJdatasetgrowth\\nDataset growth per epoch.\\nJcacheinit\\nBytes in cache at genesis.\\nJcachegrowth\\nCache growth per epoch.\\nJepoch\\nBlocks per epoch.\\nJmixbytes\\nmix length in bytes.\\nJhashbytes\\nHash length in bytes.\\nJparents\\nNumber of parents of each dataset element.\\nJcacherounds\\nNumber of rounds in cache production.\\nJaccesses\\nNumber of accesses in hashimoto loop.\\nJ.2. Size of dataset and cache. The size for Ethash’s cache c ∈B and dataset d ∈B depend on the epoch, which in\\nturn depends on the block number.\\n(227)\\nEepoch(Hi) =\\nHi\\nJepoch\\nThe size of the dataset growth by Jdatasetgrowth bytes, and the size of the cache by Jcachegrowth bytes, every epoch. In\\norder to avoid regularity leading to cyclic behavior, the size must be a prime number. Therefore the size is reduced by\\nETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER\\nEIP-150 REVISION\\na multiple of Jmixbytes, for the dataset, and Jhashbytes for the cache.

Dataset generation. In order the generate the dataset we need the cache c, which is an array of bytes. It depends\\non the cache size csize and the seed hash s ∈B32.\\nJ.3.1. Seed hash. The seed hash is different for every epoch. For the first epoch it is the Keccak-256 hash of a series of\\n32 bytes of zeros. For every other epoch it is always the Keccak-256 hash of the previous seed hash:\\n(231)\\ns = Cseedhash(Hi)\\n(232)\\nCseedhash(Hi) =\\n(\\nKEC(032)\\nif\\nEepoch(Hi) = 0\\nKEC(Cseedhash(Hi −Jepoch))\\notherwise\\nWith 032 being 32 bytes of zeros.\\nJ.3.2. Cache. The cache production process involves using the seed hash to first sequentially filling up csize bytes of\\nmemory, then performing Jcacherounds passes of the RandMemoHash algorithm created by Lerner [2014]. The intial\\ncache c′, being an array of arrays of single bytes, will be constructed as follows.\\nWe define the array ci, consisting of 64 single bytes, as the ith element of the intial cache:\\n(233)\\nci =\\n(\\nKEC512(s)\\nif\\ni = 0\\nKEC512(ci−1)\\notherwise\\nTherefore c′ can be defined as\\n(234)\\nc′[i] = ci\\n∀\\ni < n\\n(235)\\nn =\\ncsize\\nJhashbytes\\nThe cache is calculated by performing Jcacherounds rounds of the RandMemoHash algorithm to the inital cache c′:\\n(236)\\nc = Ecacherounds(c′, Jcacherounds)\\n(237)\\nEcacherounds(x, y) =\\nx\\nif\\ny = 0\\nERMH(x)\\nif\\ny = 1\\nEcacherounds(ERMH(x), y −1)\\notherwise\\nWhere a single round modifies each subset of the cache as follows:\\n(238)\\nERMH(x) =\\nErmh(x, 0), Ermh(x, 1), ..., Ermh(x, n −1)\\n(239)\\nErmh(x, i) = KEC512(x′[(i −1 + n)\\nmod n] ⊕x′[x′[i][0]\\nmod n])\\nwith\\nx′ = x\\nexcept\\nx′[j] = Ermh(x, j)\\n∀\\nj < i\\nJ.3.3. Full dataset calculation. Essentially, we combine data from Jparents pseudorandomly selected cache nodes, and\\nhash that to compute the dataset. The entire dataset is then generated by a number of items, each Jhashbytes bytes in\\nsize:\\n(240)\\nd[i] = Edatasetitem(c, i)\\n∀\\ni <\\ndsize\\nJhashbytes\\nIn order to calculate the single item we use an algorithm inspired by the FNV hash (Glenn Fowler [1991]) in some cases\\nas a non-associative substitute for XOR.\\n(241)\\nEFNV(x, y) = (x · (0x01000193 ⊕y))\\nmod 232\\nThe single item of the dataset can now be calculated as:\\n(242)\\nEdatasetitem(c, i) = Eparents(c, i, −1, ∅)\\n(243)\\nEparents(c, i, p, m) =\\n(\\nEparents(c, i, p + 1, Emix(m, c, i, p + 1))\\nif\\np < Jparents −2\\nEmix(m, c, i, p + 1)\\notherwise\\nETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER\\nEIP-150 REVISION\\n(244)\\nEmix(m, c, i, p) =\\n(\\nKEC512(c[i\\nmod csize] ⊕i)\\nif\\np = 0\\nEFNV\\nm, c[EFNV(i ⊕p, m[p\\nmod ⌊Jhashbytes/Jwordbytes⌋])\\nmod csize]\\notherwise\\nJ.4. Proof-of-work function. Essentially, we maintain a ”mix” Jmixbytes bytes wide, and repeatedly sequentially fetch\\nJmixbytes bytes from the full dataset and use the EFNV function to combine it with the mix. Jmixbytes bytes of sequential\\naccess are used so that each round of the algorithm always fetches a full page from RAM, minimizing translation lookaside\\nbuffer misses which ASICs would theoretically be able to avoid.\\nIf the output of this algorithm is below the desired target, then the nonce is valid. Note that the extra application\\nof KEC at the end ensures that there exists an intermediate nonce which can be provided to prove that at least a small\\namount of work was done; this quick outer PoW verification can be used for anti-DDoS purposes. It also serves to\\nprovide statistical assurance that the result is an unbiased, 256 bit number.\\nThe PoW-function returns an array with the compressed mix as its first item and the Keccak-256 hash of the\\nconcatenation of the compressed mix with the seed hash as the second item:\\n(245)\\nPoW(Hn, Hn, d) = {mc(KEC(RLP(LH(Hn))), Hn, d), KEC(sh(KEC(RLP(LH(Hn))), Hn) + mc(KEC(RLP(LH(Hn))), Hn, d))}\\nWith Hn being the hash of the header without the nonce. The compressed mix mc is obtained as follows:\\n(246)\\nmc(h, n, d) = Ecompress(Eaccesses(d,\\nnmix\\nX\\ni=0\\nsh(h, n), sh(h, n), −1), −4)\\nThe seed hash being:\\n(247)\\nsh(h, n) = KEC512(h + Erevert(n))\\nErevert(n) returns the reverted bytes sequence of the nonce n:\\n(248)\\nErevert(n)[i] = n[∥n∥−i]\\nWe note that the “+”-operator between two byte sequences results in the concatenation of both sequences.\\nThe dataset d is obtained as described in section J.3.3.\\nThe number of replicated sequences in the mix is:\\n(249)\\nnmix =\\nJmixbytes\\nJhashbytes\\nIn order to add random dataset nodes to the mix, the Eaccesses function is used:\\n(250)\\nEaccesses(d, m, s, i) =\\n(\\nEmixdataset(d, m, s, i)\\nif\\ni = Jaccesses −2\\nEaccesses(Emixdataset(d, m, s, i), s, i + 1)\\notherwise\\n(251)\\nEmixdataset(d, m, s, i) = EFNV(m, Enewdata(d, m, s, i)\\nEnewdata returns an array with nmix elements:\\n(252)\\nEnewdata(d, m, s, i)[j] = d[EFNV(i ⊕s[0], m[i\\nmod\\nJmixbytes\\nJwordbytes\\n])\\nmod\\ndsize/Jhashbytes\\nnmix\\n· nmix + j]\\n∀\\nj < nmix\\nThe mix is compressed as follows:\\n(253)\\nEcompress(m, i) =\\n(\\nm\\nif\\ni ⩾∥m∥−8\\nEcompress(EFNV(EFNV(EFNV(m[i + 4], m[i + 5]), m[i + 6]), m[i + 7]), i + 8)\\notherwise',\n",

PoH is used to encode trustless passage of time into\\na ledger - an append only data structure.\\nWhen used alongside a\\nconsensus algorithm such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake\\n(PoS), PoH can reduce messaging overhead in a Byzantine Fault Tol-\\nerant replicated state machine, resulting inn sub-second finality times.\\nThis paper also proposes two algorithms that leverage the time keep-\\ning properties of the PoH ledger - a PoS algorithm that can recover\\nfrom partitions of any size and an efficient streaming Proof of Replica-\\ntion (PoRep). The combination of PoRep and PoH provides a defense\\nagainst forgery of the ledger with respect to time (ordering) and stor-\\nage. The protocol is analyzed on a 1 gbps network, and this paper\\nshows that throughput up to 710k transactions per second is possible\\nwith todays hardware.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nBlockchain is an implementation of a fault tolerant replicated state machine.\\nCurrent publicly available blockchains do not rely on time, or make a weak\\nassumption about the participants abilities to keep time [4, 5]. Each node in\\nthe network usually relies on their own local clock without knowledge of any\\nother participants clocks in the network. The lack of a trusted source of time\\nmeans that when a message timestamp is used to accept or reject a message,\\nthere is no guarantee that every other participant in the network will make\\nthe exact same choice. The PoH presented here is designed to create a ledger\\nwith verifiable passage of time, i.e. duration between events and message\\nordering. It is anticipated that every node in the network will be able to rely\\non the recorded passage of time in the ledger without trust.\\nOutline\\nThe remainder of this article is organized as follows. Overall system design is\\ndescribed in Section 3. In depth description of Proof of History is described\\nin Section 4. In depth description of the proposed Proof of Stake consensus\\nalgorithm is described in Section 5. In depth description of the proposed\\nfast Proof of Replication is described in Section 6. System Architecture and\\nperformance limits are analyzed in Section 7.\\nA high performance GPU\\nfriendly smart contracts engine is described in Section 7.5\\nNetwork Design\\nAs shown in Figure 1, at any given time a system node is designated as\\nLeader to generate a Proof of History sequence, providing the network global\\nread consistency and a verifiable passage of time. The Leader sequences user\\nmessages and orders them such that they can be efficiently processed by other\\nnodes in the system, maximizing throughput. It executes the transactions\\non the current state that is stored in RAM and publishes the transactions\\nand a signature of the final state to the replications nodes called Verifiers.\\nVerifiers execute the same transactions on their copies of the state, and pub-\\nlish their computed signatures of the state as confirmations. The published\\nconfirmations serve as votes for the consensus algorithm.\\nFigure 1: Transaction flow throughout the network.\\nIn a non-partitioned state, at any given time, there is one Leader in the\\nnetwork. Each Verifier node has the same hardware capabilities as a Leader\\nand can be elected as a Leader, this is done through PoS based elections.\\nElections for the proposed PoS algorithm are covered in depth in Section 5.6.\\nIn terms of CAP theorem, Consistency is almost always picked over Avail-\\nability in an event of a Partition. In case of a large partition, this paper\\nproposes a mechanism to recover control of the network from a partition of\\nany size. This is covered in depth in Section 5.12.\\nProof of History\\nProof of History is a sequence of computation that can provide a way to\\ncryptographically verify passage of time between two events. It uses a cryp-\\ntographically secure function written so that output cannot be predicted\\nfrom the input, and must be completely executed to generate the output.\\nThe function is run in a sequence on a single core, its previous output as the\\ncurrent input, periodically recording the current output, and how many times\\nits been called. The output can then be re-computed and verified by external\\ncomputers in parallel by checking each sequence segment on a separate core.\\nData can be timestamped into this sequence by appending the data (or a\\nhash of some data) into the state of the function. The recording of the state,\\nindex and data as it was appended into the sequences provides a timestamp\\nthat can guarantee that the data was created sometime before the next hash\\nwas generated in the sequence. This design also supports horizontal scaling\\nas multiple generators can synchronize amongst each other by mixing their\\nstate into each others sequences. Horizontal scaling is discussed in depth in\\nSection 4.4\\n4.1\\nDescription\\nThe system is designed to work as follows. With a cryptographic hash func-\\ntion, whose output cannot be predicted without running the function (e.g.\\nsha256, ripemd, etc.), run the function from some random starting value\\nand take its output and pass it as the input into the same function again.\\nRecord the number of times the function has been called and the output at\\neach call. The starting random value chosen could be any string, like the\\nheadline of the New York times for the day.\\nFor example:\\nPoH Sequence\\nIndex\\nOperation\\nOutput Hash\\nsha256(”any random starting value”)\\nhash1\\nsha256(hash1)\\nhash2\\nsha256(hash2)\\nhash3\\nWhere hashN represents the actual hash output.\\nIt is only necessary to publish a subset of the hashes and indices at an\\ninterval.\\nFor example:\\nPoH Sequence\\nIndex\\nOperation\\nOutput Hash\\nsha256(”any random starting value”)\\nhash1\\nsha256(hash199)\\nhash200\\nsha256(hash299)\\nhash300\\nAs long as the hash function chosen is collision resistant, this set of hashes\\ncan only be computed in sequence by a single computer thread. This follows\\nfrom the fact that there is no way to predict what the hash value at index\\n300 is going to be without actually running the algorithm from the starting\\nvalue 300 times. Thus we can thus infer from the data structure that real\\ntime has passed between index 0 and index 300.\\nIn the example in Figure 2, hash 62f51643c1 was produced on count\\n510144806912 and hash c43d862d88 was produced on count 510146904064.\\nFollowing the previously discussed properties of the PoH algorithm, we can\\ntrust that real time passed between count 510144806912 and count 510146904064.\\nFigure 2: Proof of History sequence\\n4.2\\nTimestamp for Events\\nThis sequence of hashes can also be used to record that some piece of data\\nwas created before a particular hash index was generated. Using a ‘combine‘\\nfunction to combine the piece of data with the current hash at the current\\nindex. The data can simply be a cryptographically unique hash of arbitrary\\nevent data. The combine function can be a simple append of data, or any\\noperation that is collision resistant. The next generated hash represents a\\ntimestamp of the data, because it could have only been generated after that\\nspecific piece of data was inserted.\\nFor example:\\nPoH Sequence\\nIndex\\nOperation\\nOutput Hash\\nsha256(”any random starting value”)\\nhash1\\nsha256(hash199)\\nhash200\\nsha256(hash299)\\nhash300\\nSome external event occurs, like a photograph was taken, or any arbitrary\\ndigital data was created:\\nPoH Sequence With Data\\nIndex\\nOperation\\nOutput Hash\\nsha256(”any random starting value”)\\nhash1\\nsha256(hash199)\\nhash200\\nsha256(hash299)\\nhash300\\nsha256(append(hash335, photograph sha256))\\nhash336\\nHash336 is computed from the appended binary data of hash335 and the\\nsha256 of the photograph. The index and the sha256 of the photograph are\\nrecorded as part of the sequence output. So anyone verifying this sequence\\ncan then recreate this change to the sequence. The verifying can still be done\\nin parallel and its discussed in Section 4.3\\nBecause the initial process is still sequential, we can then tell that things\\nentered into the sequence must have occurred sometime before the future\\nhashed value was computed.\\nPOH Sequence\\nIndex\\nOperation\\nOutput Hash\\nsha256(”any random starting value”)\\nhash1\\nsha256(hash199)\\nhash200\\nsha256(hash299)\\nhash300\\nsha256(append(hash335, photograph1 sha256))\\nhash336\\nsha256(hash399)\\nhash400\\nsha256(hash499)\\nhash500\\nsha256(append(hash599, photograph2 sha256))\\nhash600\\nsha256(hash699)\\nhash700\\nTable 1: PoH Sequence With 2 Events\\nIn the sequence represented by Table 1, photograph2 was created before\\nhash600, and photograph1 was created before hash336. Inserting the data\\ninto the sequence of hashes results in a change to all subsequent values in the\\nsequence. As long as the hash function used is collision resistant, and the\\ndata was appended, it should be computationally impossible to pre-compute\\nany future sequences based on prior knowledge of what data will be inte-\\ngrated into the sequence.\\nThe data that is mixed into the sequence can be the raw data itself, or\\njust a hash of the data with accompanying metadata.\\nIn the example in Figure 3, input cfd40df8... was inserted into the\\nProof of History sequence. The count at which it was inserted is 510145855488\\nand the state at which it was inserted it is 3d039eef3. All the future gen-\\nerated hashes are modified by this change to the sequence, this change is\\nindicated by the color change in the figure.\\nEvery node observing this sequence can determine the order at which all\\nevents have been inserted and estimate the real time between the insertions.\\nFigure 3: Inserting data into Proof of History\\n4.3\\nVerification\\nThe sequence can be verified correct by a multicore computer in significantly\\nless time than it took to generate it.\\nFor example:\\nCore 1\\nIndex\\nData\\nOutput Hash\\nsha256(hash199)\\nhash200\\nsha256(hash299)\\nhash300\\nCore 2\\nIndex\\nData\\nOutput Hash\\nsha256(hash299)\\nhash300\\nsha256(hash399)\\nhash400\\nGiven some number of cores, like a modern GPU with 4000 cores, the\\nverifier can split up the sequence of hashes and their indexes into 4000 slices,\\nand in parallel make sure that each slice is correct from the starting hash to\\nthe last hash in the slice. If the expected time to produce the sequence is\\ngoing to be:\\nFigure 4: Verification using multiple cores\\nTotal number of hashes\\nHashes per second for 1 core\\nThe expected time to verify that the sequence is correct is going to be:\\nTotal number of hashes\\n(Hashes per second per core * Number of cores available to verify)\\nIn the example in Figure 4, each core is able to verify each slice of the\\nsequence in parallel. Since all input strings are recorded into the output, with\\nthe counter and state that they are appended to, the verifiers can replicate\\neach slice in parallel. The red colored hashes indicate that the sequence was\\nmodified by a data insertion.\\n4.4\\nHorizontal Scaling\\nIts possible to synchronize multiple Proof of History generators by mixing the\\nsequence state from each generator to each other generator, and thus achieve\\nhorizontal scaling of the Proof of History generator. This scaling is done\\nwithout sharding. The output of both generators is necessary to reconstruct\\nthe full order of events in the system.\\nPoH Generator A\\nIndex\\nHash\\nData\\nhash1a\\nhash2a\\nhash1b\\nhash3a\\nhash4a\\nPoH Generator B\\nIndex\\nHash\\nData\\nhash1b\\nhash2b\\nhash1a\\nhash3b\\nhash4b\\nGiven generators A and B, A receives a data packet from B (hash1b),\\nwhich contains the last state from Generator B, and the last state generator\\nB observed from Generator A. The next state hash in Generator A then de-\\npends on the state from Generator B, so we can derive that hash1b happened\\nsometime before hash3a. This property can be transitive, so if three gener-\\nators are synchronized through a single common generator A ↔B ↔C,\\nwe can trace the dependency between A and C even though they were not\\nsynchronized directly.\\nBy periodically synchronizing the generators, each generator can then\\nhandle a portion of external traffic, thus the overall system can handle a\\nlarger amount of events to track at the cost of true time accuracy due to\\nnetwork latencies between the generators. A global order can still be achieved\\nby picking some deterministic function to order any events that are within\\nthe synchronization window, such as by the value of the hash itself.\\nIn Figure 5, the two generators insert each others output state and record\\nthe operation. The color change indicates that data from the peer had mod-\\nified the sequence. The generated hashes that are mixed into each stream\\nare highlighted in bold.\\nThe synchronization is transitive. A ↔B ↔C There is a provable order\\nof events between A and C through B.\\nScaling in this way comes at the cost of availability. 10 × 1 gbps connec-\\ntions with availability of 0.999 would have 0.99910 = 0.99 availability.\\n4.5\\nConsistency\\nUsers are expected to be able to enforce consistency of the generated se-\\nquence and make it resistant to attacks by inserting the last observed output\\nof the sequence they consider valid into their input.\\nFigure 5: Two generators synchronizing\\nPoH Sequence A\\nIndex\\nData\\nOutput Hash\\nhash10a\\nEvent1\\nhash20a\\nEvent2\\nhash30a\\nEvent3\\nhash40a\\nPoH Hidden Sequence B\\nIndex\\nData\\nOutput Hash\\nhash10b\\nEvent3\\nhash20b\\nEvent2\\nhash30b\\nEvent1\\nhash40b\\nA malicious PoH generator could produce a second hidden sequence with\\nthe events in reverse order, if it has access to all the events at once, or is able\\nto generate a faster hidden sequence.\\nTo prevent this attack, each client-generated Event should contain within\\nitself the latest hash that the client observed from what it considers to be\\na valid sequence. So when a client creates the ”Event1” data, they should\\nappend the last hash they have observed.\\nPoH Sequence A\\nIndex\\nData\\nOutput Hash\\nhash10a\\nEvent1 = append(event1 data, hash10a)\\nhash20a\\nEvent2 = append(event2 data, hash20a)\\nhash30a\\nEvent3 = append(event3 data, hash30a)\\nhash40a\\nWhen the sequence is published, Event3 would be referencing hash30a,\\nand if its not in the sequence prior to this Event, the consumers of the\\nsequence know that its an invalid sequence. The partial reordering attack\\nwould then be limited to the number of hashes produced while the client has\\nobserved an event and when the event was entered. Clients should then be\\nable to write software that does not assume the order is correct for the short\\nperiod of hashes between the last observed and inserted hash.\\nTo prevent a malicious PoH generator from rewriting the client Event\\nhashes, the clients can submit a signature of the event data and the last\\nobserved hash instead of just the data.\\nPoH Sequence A\\nIndex\\nData\\nOutput Hash\\nhash10a\\nEvent1 = sign(append(event1 data, hash10a),\\nClient Private Key)\\nhash20a\\nEvent2 = sign(append(event2 data, hash20a),\\nClient Private Key)\\nhash30a\\nEvent3 = sign(append(event3 data, hash30a),\\nClient Private Key)\\nhash40a\\nVerification of this data requires a signature verification, and a lookup of\\nthe hash in the sequence of hashes prior to this one.\\nVerify:\\n(Signature, PublicKey, hash30a, event3 data) = Event3\\nVerify(Signature, PublicKey, Event3)\\nLookup(hash30a, PoHSequence)\\nIn Figure 6, the user-supplied input is dependent on hash 0xdeadbeef...\\nexisting in the generated sequence sometime before its inserted. The blue\\nFigure 6: Input with a back reference.\\ntop left arrow indicates that the client is referencing a previously produced\\nhash. The clients message is only valid in a sequence that contains the hash\\n0xdeadbeef.... The red color in the sequence indicates that the sequence\\nhas been modified by the clients data.\\n4.6\\nOverhead\\n4000 hashes per second would generate an additional 160 kilobytes of data,\\nand would require access to a GPU with 4000 cores and roughly 0.25-0.75\\nmilliseconds of time to verify.\\n4.7\\nAttacks\\n4.7.1\\nReversal\\nGenerating a reverse order would require an attacker to start the malicious\\nsequence after the second event. This delay should allow any non malicious\\npeer to peer nodes to communicate about the original order.\\n4.7.2\\nSpeed\\nHaving multiple generators may make deployment more resistant to attacks.\\nOne generator could be high bandwidth, and receive many events to mix\\ninto its sequence, another generator could be high speed low bandwidth that\\nperiodically mixes with the high bandwidth generator.\\nThe high speed sequence would create a secondary sequence of data that\\nan attacker would have to reverse.\\n4.7.3\\nLong Range Attacks\\nLong range attacks involve acquiring old discarded client Private Keys, and\\ngenerating a falsified ledger [10]. Proof of History provides some protection\\nagainst long range attacks. A malicious user that gains access to old private\\nkeys would have to recreate a historical record that takes as much time as the\\noriginal one they are trying to forge. This would require access to a faster\\nprocessor than the network is currently using, otherwise the attacker would\\nnever catch up in history length.\\nAdditionally, a single source of time allows for construction of a simpler\\nProof of Replication (more on that in Section 6). Since the network is de-\\nsigned so that all participants in the network will rely on a single historical\\nrecord of events.\\nPoRep and PoH together should provide a defense of both space and time\\nagainst a forged ledger.\\nProof of Stake Consensus\\n5.1\\nDescription\\nThis specific instance of Proof of Stake is designed for quick confirmation of\\nthe current sequence produced by the Proof of History generator, for voting\\nand selecting the next Proof of History generator, and for punishing any mis-\\nbehaving validators. This algorithm depends on messages eventually arriving\\nto all participating nodes within a certain timeout.\\n5.2\\nTerminology\\nbonds Bonds are equivalent to a capital expense in Proof of Work. A miner\\nbuys hardware and electricity, and commits it to a single branch in a\\nProof of Work blockchain. A bond is coin that the validator commits\\nas collateral while they are validating transactions.\\nslashing The proposed solution to the nothing at stake problem in Proof\\nof Stake systems [7]. When a proof of voting for a different branch\\nis published, that branch can destroy the validators bond. This is an\\neconomic incentive designed to discourage validators from confirming\\nmultiple branches.\\nsuper majority A super majority is 2\\n3rds of the validators weighted by their\\nbonds. A super majority vote indicates that the network has reached\\nconsensus, and at least\\n3rd of the network would have had to vote\\nmaliciously for this branch to be invalid. This would put the economic\\ncost of an attack at 1\\n3rd of the market cap of the coin.\\n5.3\\nBonding\\nA bonding transaction takes a amount of coin and moves it to a bonding\\naccount under the users identity. Coins in the bonding account cannot be\\nspent and have to remain in the account until the user removes them. The\\nuser can only remove stale coins that have timed out. Bonds are valid after\\nsuper majority of the current stakeholders have confirmed the sequence.\\n5.4\\nVoting\\nIt is anticipated that the Proof of History generator will be able to publish\\na signature of the state at a predefined period. Each bonded identity must\\nconfirm that signature by publishing their own signed signature of the state.\\nThe vote is a simple yes vote, without a no.\\nIf super majority of the bonded identities have voted within a timeout,\\nthen this branch would be accepted as valid.\\n5.5\\nUnbonding\\nMissing N number of votes marks the coins as stale and no longer eligible for\\nvoting. The user can issue an unbonding transaction to remove them.\\nN is a dynamic value based on the ratio of stale to active votes.\\nN\\nincreases as the number of stale votes increases.\\nIn an event of a large\\nnetwork partition, this allows the larger branch to recover faster then the\\nsmaller branch.\\n5.6\\nElections\\nElection for a new PoH generator occur when the PoH generator failure is\\ndetected. The validator with the largest voting power, or highest public key\\naddress if there is a tie is picked as the new PoH generator.\\nA super majority of confirmations are required on the new sequence. If\\nthe new leader fails before a super majority confirmations are available, the\\nnext highest validator is selected, and a new set of confirmations is required.\\nTo switch votes, a validator needs to vote at a higher PoH sequence\\ncounter, and the new vote needs to contain the votes it wants to switch.\\nOtherwise the second vote will be slashable. Vote switching is expected to\\nbe designed so that it can only occur at a height that does not have a super\\nmajority.\\nOnce a PoH generator is established, a Secondary can be elected to take\\nover the transactional processing duties. If a Secondary exists, it will be\\nconsidered as the next leader during a Primary failure.\\nThe platform is designed so that the Secondary becomes Primary and\\nlower rank generators are promoted if an exception is detected or on a pre-\\ndefined schedule.\\n5.7\\nElection Triggers\\n5.7.1\\nForked Proof of History generator\\nPoH generators are designed with an identity that signs the generated se-\\nquence. A fork can only occur in case the PoH generators identity has been\\ncompromised. A fork is detected because two different historical records have\\nbeen published on the same PoH identity.\\n5.7.2\\nRuntime Exceptions\\nA hardware failure or a bug, or a intentional error in the PoH generator could\\ncause it to generate an invalid state and publish a signature of the state that\\ndoes not match the local validators result. Validators will publish the correct\\nsignature via gossip and this event would trigger a new round of elections.\\nAny validators who accept an invalid state will have their bonds slashed.\\n5.7.3\\nNetwork Timeouts\\nA network timeout would trigger an election.\\n5.8\\nSlashing\\nSlashing occurs when a validator votes two separate sequences. A proof of\\nmalicious vote will remove the bonded coins from circulation and add them\\nto the mining pool.\\nA vote that includes a previous vote on a contending sequence is not\\neligible as proof of malicious voting. Instead of slashing the bonds, this vote\\nremoves remove the currently cast vote on the contending sequence.\\nSlashing also occurs if a vote is cast for an invalid hash generated by the\\nPoH generator. The generator is expected to randomly generate an invalid\\nstate, which would trigger a fallback to Secondary.\\n5.9\\nSecondary Elections\\nSecondary and lower ranked Proof of History generators can be proposed\\nand approved. A proposal is cast on the primary generators sequence. The\\nproposal contains a timeout, if the motion is approved by a super majority\\nof the vote before the timeout, the Secondary is considered elected, and will\\ntake over duties as scheduled. Primary can do a soft handover to Secondary\\nby inserting a message into the generated sequence indicating that a handover\\nwill occur, or inserting an invalid state and forcing the network to fallback\\nto Secondary.\\nIf a Secondary is elected, and the primary fails, the Secondary will be\\nconsidered as the first fallback during an election.\\n5.10\\nAvailability\\nCAP systems that deal with partitions have to pick Consistency or Avail-\\nability.\\nOur approach eventually picks Availability, but because we have\\nan objective measure of time, Consistency is picked with reasonable human\\ntimeouts.\\nProof of Stake verifiers lock up some amount of coin in a stake, which\\nallows them to vote for a particular set of transactions. Locking up coin is a\\ntransaction that is entered into a PoH stream, just like any other transaction.\\nTo vote, a PoS verifier has to sign the hash of the state, as it was computed\\nafter processing all the transactions to a specific position in the PoH ledger.\\nThis vote is also entered as a transaction into the PoH stream. Looking at\\nthe PoH ledger, we can then infer how much time passed between each vote,\\nand if a partition occurs, for how long each verifier has been unavailable.\\nTo deal with partitions with reasonable human timeframes, we propose\\na dynamic approach to unstake unavailable verifiers. When the number of\\nverifiers is high and above 2\\n3, the unstaking process can be fast. The number\\nof hashes that must be generated into the ledger is low before the unavailable\\nverifiers stake is fully unstaked and they are no longer counted for consensus.\\nWhen the number of verifiers is below 2\\n3rds but above 1\\n2, the unstaking timer is\\nslower, requiring a larger number of hashes to be generated before the missing\\nverifiers are unstaked. In a large partition, like a partition that is missing 1\\nor more of the verifiers, the unstaking process is very very slow. Transactions\\ncan still be entered into the stream, and verifiers can still vote, but full 2\\n3rds\\nconsensus will not be achieved until a very large amount of hashes have been\\ngenerated and the unavailable verifiers have been unstaked. The difference\\nin time for a network to regain liveness allows us as customers of the network\\nhuman timeframes to pick a partition that we want to continue using.\\n5.11\\nRecovery\\nIn the system we propose, the ledger can be fully recovered from any failure.\\nThat means, anyone in the world can pick any random spot in the ledger and\\ncreate a valid fork by appending newly generated hashes and transactions.\\nIf all the verifiers are missing from this fork, it would take a very very long\\ntime for any additional bonds to become valid and for this branch to achieve\\n3rds super majority consensus. So full recovery with zero available validators\\nwould require a very large amount of hashes to be appended to the ledger,\\nand only after all the unavailable validators have been unstaked will any new\\nbonds be able to validate the ledger.\\n5.12\\nFinality\\nPoH allows verifiers of the network to observe what happened in the past with\\nsome degree of certainty of the time of those events. As the PoH generator is\\nproducing a stream of messages, all the verifiers are required to submit their\\nsignatures of the state within 500ms. This number can be reduced further\\ndepending on network conditions. Since each verification is entered into the\\nstream, everyone in the network can validate that every verifier submitted\\ntheir votes within the required timeout without actually observing the voting\\ndirectly.\\n5.13\\nAttacks\\n5.13.1\\nTragedy of Commons\\nThe PoS verifiers simply confirm the state hash generated by the PoH gen-\\nerator. There is an economic incentive for them to do no work and simply\\napprove every generated state hash. To avoid this condition, the PoH gener-\\nator should inject an invalid hash at a random interval. Any voters for this\\nhash should be slashed. When the hash is generated, the network should\\nimmediately promote the Secondary elected PoH generator.\\nEach verifier is required to respond within a small timeout - 500ms for\\nexample. The timeout should be set low enough that a malicious verifier has\\na low probability of observing another verifiers vote and getting their votes\\ninto the stream fast enough.\\n5.13.2\\nCollusion with the PoH generator\\nA verifier that is colluding with the PoH generator would know in advance\\nwhen the invalid hash is going to be produced and not vote for it. This\\nscenario is really no different than the PoH identity having a larger verifier\\nstake. The PoH generator still has to do all the work to produce the state\\nhash.\\n5.13.3\\nCensorship\\nCensorship or denial of service could occur when a 1\\n3rd of the bond holders\\nrefuse to validate any sequences with new bonds. The protocol can defend\\nagainst this form of attack by dynamically adjusting how fast bonds become\\nstale. In the event of a denial of service, the larger partition will be designed\\nto fork and censor the Byzantine bond holders. The larger network will re-\\ncover as the Byzantine bonds become stale with time. The smaller Byzantine\\npartition would not be able to move forward for a longer period of time.\\nThe algorithm would work as follows. A majority of the network would\\nelect a new Leader.\\nThe Leader would then censor the Byzantine bond\\nholders from participating. Proof of History generator would have to continue\\ngenerating a sequence, to prove the passage of time, until enough Byzantine\\nbonds have become stale so the bigger network has a super majority. The rate\\nat which bonds become stale would be dynamically based on what percentage\\nof bonds are active. So the Byzantine minority fork of the network would have\\nto wait much longer than the majority fork to recover a super majority. Once\\na super majority has been established, slashing could be used to permanently\\npunish the Byzantine bond holders.\\n5.13.4\\nLong Range Attacks\\nPoH provides a natural defense against long range attacks. Recovering the\\nledger from any point in the past would require the attacker to overtake the\\nvalid ledger in time by outpacing the speed of the PoH generator.\\nThe consensus protocol provides a second layer of defense, as any attack\\nwould have to take longer then the time it takes to unstake all the valid\\nvalidators. It also creates an availability gap in the history of the ledger.\\nWhen comparing two ledgers of the same height, the one with the smallest\\nmaximum partition can be objectively considered as valid.\\n5.13.5\\nASIC Attacks\\nTwo opportunities for an ASIC attacks exist in this protocol - during parti-\\ntion, and cheating timeouts in Finality.\\nFor ASIC attacks during Partitions, the Rate at which bonds are unstaked\\nis non-linear, and for networks with large partitions the rate is orders of\\nmagnitude slower then expected gains from an ASIC attack.\\nFor ASIC attacks during Finality, the vulnerability allows for byzantine\\nvalidators who have a bonded stake wait for confirmations from other nodes\\nand inject their votes with a collaborating PoH generator. The PoH gener-\\nator can then use its faster ASIC to generate 500ms worth of hashes in less\\ntime, and allow for network communication between PoH generator and the\\ncollaborating nodes. But, if the PoH generator is also byzantine, there is no\\nreason why the byzantine generator wouldnt have communicated the exact\\ncounter when they expect to insert the failure. This scenario is no different\\nthan a PoH generator and all the collaborators sharing the same identity and\\nhaving a single combined stake and only using 1 set of hardware.\\nStreaming Proof of Replication\\n6.1\\nDescription\\nFilecoin proposed a version of Proof of Replication [6].\\nThe goal of this\\nversion is to have fast and streaming verifications of Proof of Replication,\\nwhich are enabled by keeping track of time in Proof of History generated\\nsequence. Replication is not used as a consensus algorithm, but is a useful\\ntool to account for the cost of storing the blockchain history or state at a\\nhigh availability.\\n6.2\\nAlgorithm\\nAs shown in Figure 7 CBC encryption encrypts each block of data in se-\\nquence, using the previously encrypted block to XOR the input data.\\nEach replication identity generates a key by signing a hash that has been\\ngenerated Proof of History sequence. This ties the key to a replicators iden-\\ntity, and to a specific Proof of History sequence. Only specific hashes can be\\nselected. (See Section 6.5 on Hash Selection)\\nThe data set is fully encrypted block by block. Then to generate a proof,\\nthe key is used to seed a pseudorandom number generator that selects a\\nrandom 32 bytes from each block.\\nA merkle hash is computed with the selected PoH hash prepended to the\\neach slice.\\nThe root is published, along with the key, and the selected hash that\\nwas generated. The replication node is required to publish another proof\\nFigure 7: Sequential CBC encryption\\nFigure 8: Fast Proof of Replication\\nin N hashes as they are generated by Proof of History generator, where N\\nis approximately\\n2 the time it takes to encrypt the data.\\nThe Proof of\\nHistory generator will publish specific hashes for Proof of Replication at a\\npredefined periods. The replicator node must select the next published hash\\nfor generating the proof. Again, the hash is signed, and random slices are\\nselected from the blocks to create the merkle root.\\nAfter a period of N proofs, the data is re-encrypted with a new CBC key.\\n6.3\\nVerification\\nWith N cores, each core can stream encryption for each identity. Total space\\nrequired is 2blocks ∗Ncores, since the previous encrypted block is necessary\\nto generate the next one. Each core can then be used to generate all the\\nproofs that derived from the current encrypted block.\\nTotal time to verify proofs is expected to be equal to the time it takes to\\nencrypt. The proofs themselves consume few random bytes from the block,\\nso the amount of data to hash is significantly lower then the encrypted block\\nsize. The number of replication identities that can be verified at the same\\ntime is equal to the number of available cores. Modern GPUs have 3500+\\ncores available to them, albeit at 1\\n2- 1\\n3 the clock speed of a CPU.\\n6.4\\nKey Rotation\\nWithout key rotation the same encrypted replication can generate cheap\\nproofs for multiple Proof of History sequences. Keys are rotated periodically\\nand each replication is re-encrypted with a new key that is tied to a unique\\nProof of History sequence.\\nRotation needs to be slow enough that its practical to verify replication\\nproofs on GPU hardware, which is slower per core than CPUs.\\n6.5\\nHash Selection\\nProof of History generator publishes a hash to be used by the entire network\\nfor encrypting Proofs of Replication, and for using as the pseudorandom\\nnumber generator for byte selection in fast proofs.\\nHash is published at a periodic counter that is roughly equal to 1\\n2 the time\\nit takes to encrypt the data set. Each replication identity must use the same\\nhash, and use the signed result of the hash as the seed for byte selection, or\\nthe encryption key.\\nThe period that each replicator must provide a proof must be smaller than\\nthe encryption time. Otherwise the replicator can stream the encryption and\\ndelete it for each proof.\\nA malicious generator could inject data into the sequence prior to this\\nhash to generate a specific hash. This attack is discussed more in 5.13.2.\\n6.6\\nProof Validation\\nThe Proof of History node is not expected to validate the submitted Proof\\nof Replication proofs. It is expected to keep track of number of pending and\\nverified proofs submitted by the replicators identity. A proof is expected to\\nbe verified when the replicator is able to sign the proof by a super majority\\nof the validators in the network.\\nThe verifications are collected by the replicator via p2p gossip network,\\nand submitted as one packet that contains a super majority of the validators\\nin the network. This packet verifies all the proofs prior to a specific hash gen-\\nerated by the Proof of History sequence, and can contain multiple replicator\\nidentities at once.\\n6.7\\nAttacks\\n6.7.1\\nSpam\\nA malicious user could create many replicator identities and spam the net-\\nwork with bad proofs. To facilitate faster verification, nodes are required\\nto provide the encrypted data and the entire merkle tree to the rest of the\\nnetwork when they request verification.\\nThe Proof of Replication that is designed in this paper allows for cheap\\nverification of any additional proofs, as they take no additional space. But\\neach identity would consume 1 core of encryption time. The replication target\\nshould be set to a maximum size of readily available cores. Modern GPUs\\nship with 3500+ cores.\\n6.7.2\\nPartial Erasure\\nA replicator node could attempt to partially erase some of the data to avoid\\nstoring the entire state. The number of proofs and the randomness of the\\nseed should make this attack difficult.\\nFor example, a user storing 1 terabyte of data erases a single byte from\\neach 1 megabyte block.\\nA single proof that samples 1 byte out of every\\nmegabyte would have a likelihood of collision with any erased byte 1 −(1 −\\n1/1, 000, 0000)1,000,000 = 0.63. After 5 proofs the likelihood is 0.99.\\n6.7.3\\nCollusion with PoH generator\\nThe signed hash is expected to be used to seed the sample. If a replicator\\ncould select a specific hash in advance then the replicator could erase all\\nbytes that are not going to be sampled.\\nA replicator identity that is colluding with the Proof of History generator\\ncould inject a specific transaction at the end of the sequence before the pre-\\ndefined hash for random byte selection is generated. With enough cores, an\\nattacker could generate a hash that is preferable to the replicators identity.\\nThis attack could only benefit a single replicator identity. Since all the\\nidentities have to use the same exact hash that is cryptographically signed\\nwith ECDSA (or equivalent), the resulting signature is unique for each repli-\\ncator identity, and collision resistant. A single replicator identity would only\\nhave marginal gains.\\n6.7.4\\nDenial of Service\\nThe cost of adding an additional replicator identity is expected to be equal\\nto the cost of storage. The cost of adding extra computational capacity to\\nverify all the replicator identities is expected to be equal to the cost of a CPU\\nor GPU core per replication identity.\\nThis creates an opportunity for a denial of service attack on the network\\nby creating a large number of valid replicator identities.\\nTo limit this attack, the consensus protocol chosen for the network can\\nselect a replication target, and award the replication proofs that meet the de-\\nsired characteristics, like availability on the network, bandwidth, geolocation\\netc...\\n6.7.5\\nTragedy of Commons\\nThe PoS verifiers could simply confirm PoRep without doing any work. The\\neconomic incentives should be lined up with the PoS verifiers to do work,\\nFigure 9: System Architecture\\nlike by splitting the mining payout between the PoS verifiers and the PoRep\\nreplication nodes.\\nTo further avoid this scenario, the PoRep verifiers can submit false proofs\\na small percentage of the time. They can prove the proof is false by providing\\nthe function that generated the false data. Any PoS verifier that confirmed\\na false proof would be slashed.\\nSystem Architecture\\n7.1\\nComponents\\n7.1.1\\nLeader, Proof of History generator\\nThe Leader is an elected Proof of History generator. It consumes arbitrary\\nuser transactions and outputs a Proof of History sequence of all the transac-\\ntions that guarantees a unique global order in the system. After each batch\\nof transactions the Leader outputs a signature of the state that is the result\\nof running the transactions in that order. This signature is signed with the\\nidentity of the Leader.\\n7.1.2\\nState\\nA naive hash table indexed by the users address. Each cell contains the full\\nusers address and the memory required for this computation. For example\\nTransaction table contains:\\n31\\n95\\n159\\n223\\nRipemd of Users Public Key\\nAccount\\nunused\\nFor a total of 32 bytes.\\nProof of Stake bonds table contains:\\n31\\n95\\n159\\n223\\nRipemd of Users Public Key\\nBond\\nLast Vote\\nunused\\nFor a total of 64 bytes.\\n7.1.3\\nVerifier, State Replication\\nThe Verifier nodes replicate the blockchain state and provide high availability\\nof the blockchain state. The replication target is selected by the consensus\\nalgorithm, and the validators in the consensus algorithm select and vote the\\nProof of Replication nodes they approve of based on off-chain defined criteria.\\nThe network could be configured with a minimum Proof of Stake bond\\nsize, and a requirement for a single replicator identity per bond.\\n7.1.4\\nValidators\\nThese nodes are consuming bandwidth from Verifiers. They are virtual nodes,\\nand can run on the same machines as the Verifiers or the Leader, or on\\nseparate machines that are specific to the consensus algorithm configured for\\nthis network.\\n7.2\\nNetwork Limits\\nLeader is expected to be able to take incoming user packets, orders them\\nthe most efficient way possible, and sequences them into a Proof of History\\nsequence that is published to downstream Verifiers. Efficiency is based on\\nFigure 10: Generator network limits\\nmemory access patterns of the transactions, so the transactions are ordered\\nto minimize faults and to maximize prefetching.\\nIncoming packet format:\\n31\\n95\\n159\\n223\\nLast Valid Hash\\nCounter\\nu s\\nFee\\nFrom\\nSigned\\nSignature 1 of 2\\nSignature 2 of 2\\nSize 20 + 8 + 16 + 8 + 32 + 3232 = 148 bytes.\\nThe minimal payload that can be supported would be 1 destination ac-\\ncount.

This packet is sent once\\nevery N messages are broadcast.\\nProof of History packet:\\n31\\n95\\n159\\n223\\nCurrent Hash\\nCounter\\nMessages Hash\\nState Hash\\nSigned\\nSignature 1 of 2\\nSignature 2 of 2\\nMinimum size of the output packet is: 132 bytes\\nOn a 1gbps network connection the maximum number of transactions\\npossible is 1 gigabit per second / 176 bytes = 710k tps max. Some loss 1−4%\\nis expected due to Ethernet framing. The spare capacity over the target\\namount for the network can be used to increase availability by coding the\\noutput with Reed-Solomon codes and striping it to the available downstream\\nVerifiers.\\n7.3\\nComputational Limits\\nEach transaction requires a digest verification. This operation does not use\\nany memory outside of the transaction message itself and can be parallelized\\nindependently. Thus throughput is expected to be limited by the number of\\ncores available on the system.\\nGPU based ECDSA verification servers have had experimental results of\\n900k operations per second [9].\\n7.4\\nMemory Limits\\nA naive implementation of the state as a 50% full hashtable with 32 byte en-\\ntries for each account, would theoretically fit 10 billion accounts into 640GB.\\nSteady state random access to this table is measured at 1.1 ∗107 writes or\\nreads per second. Based on 2 reads and two writes per transaction, memory\\nthroughput can handle 2.75m transactions per second. This was measured\\non an Amazon Web Services 1TB x1.16xlarge instance.\\n7.5\\nHigh Performance Smart Contracts\\nSmart contracts are a generalized form of transactions. These are programs\\nthat run on each node and modify the state. This design leverages extended\\nBerkeley Packet Filter bytecode as fast and easy to analyze and JIT bytecode\\nas the smart contracts language.\\nOne of its main advantages is a zero cost Foreign Function Interface.\\nIntrinsics, or functions that are implemented on the platform directly, are\\ncallable by\\nprograms.\\nCalling the intrinsics suspends that program and\\nschedules the intrinsic on a high performance server. Intrinsics are batched\\ntogether to execute in parallel on the GPU.\\nIn the above example, two different user programs call the same intrinsic.\\nEach program is suspended until the batch execution of the intrinsics is\\nFigure 11: Executing BPF programs.\\ncomplete. An example intrinsic is ECDSA verification. Batching these calls\\nto execute on the GPU can increase throughput by thousands of times.\\nThis trampoline requires no native operating system thread context switches,\\nsince the BPF bytecode has a well defined context for all the memory that\\nit is using.\\neBPF backend has been included in LLVM since 2015, so any LLVM\\nfrontend language can be used to write smart contracts.\\nIts been in the\\nLinux kernel since 2015, and the first iterations of the bytecode have been\\naround since 1992. A single pass can check eBPF for correctness, ascertain\\nits runtime and memory requirements and convert it to x86 instructions.\\nReferences\\n[1] Liskov, Practical use of Clocks\\nhttp://www.dainf.cefetpr.br/ tacla/SDII/PracticalUseOfClocks.pdf\\n[2] Google Spanner TrueTime consistency\\nhttps://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/true-time-external-consistency\\n[3] Solving Agreement with Ordering Oracles\\nhttp://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/pedone/Paper/2002/2002EDCCb.pdf\\n[4] Tendermint: Consensus without Mining\\nhttps://tendermint.com/static/docs/tendermint.pdf\\n[5] Hedera: A Governing Council & Public Hashgraph Network\\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/hedera-hashgraph/hh-whitepaper-v1.0-180313.pdf\\n[6] Filecoin, proof of replication,\\nhttps://filecoin.io/proof-of-replication.pdf\\n[7] Slasher, A punative Proof of Stake algorithm\\nhttps://blog.ethereum.org/2014/01/15/slasher-a-punitive-proof-of-stake-algorith\\n[8] BitShares Delegated Proof of Stake\\nhttps://github.com/BitShares/bitshares/wiki/Delegated-Proof-of-Stake\\n[9] An Efficient Elliptic Curve Cryptography Signature Server With GPU\\nAcceleration\\nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7555336/\\n[10] Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget\\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09437.pdf',\n",

Lenders provide liquidity by depositing cryptocurrencies in a pool contract. Simultaneously, in the same contract, the pooled funds can be borrowed by placing a collateral. Loans do not need to be individually matched, instead they rely on the pooled funds, as well as the amounts borrowed and their collateral. This enables instant loans with characteristics based on the state of the pool. A simplified scheme of the protocol is presented in figure 1 below. Figure 1: The Aave Protocol The interest rate for both borrowers and lenders is decided algorithmically: • For borrowers, it depends on the cost of money - the amount of funds available in the pool at a specific time. As funds are borrowed from the pool, the amount of funds available decreases which raises the interest rate. • For lenders, this interest rate corresponds to the earn rate, with the algorithm safeguarding a liquidity reserve to guarantee withdrawals at any time. 1.1 Basic Concepts Figure 2: Lending Pool Basics At'},\n",

A reserve accepts deposits from lenders. Users can borrow these funds, granted that they lock a greater value as collateral, which backs the borrow position. Specific currencies in the pooled reserves can be configured as collateral or not for borrow positions, only low risk tokens should be considered. The amount one can borrow depends on the currencies deposited still available in the reserves. Every reserve has a specific Loan-To-Value (LTV), calculated as the weighted average of the different LTVs of the currencies composing the collateral, where the weight for each LTV is the equivalent amount of the collateral in ETH; figure 3 shows an example of parameters. Every borrow position can be opened with a stable or variable rate. Borrows have infinite duration, and there is no repayment schedule: partial or full repayments can be made anytime. Figure 3: Lending Pool Parameters In case of price fluctuations, a borrow position might be liquidated. A liquidation event happens when the price of the collateral drops below the threshold, LQ, called liquidation threshold. Reaching this ratio channels a liquida- tion bonus, which incentivizes liquidators to buy the collateral at a discounted price. Every reserve has a specific liquidation threshold, following the same approach as for the LTV. Calculation of the average liquidation threshold La Q is performed dynamically, using the weighted average of the liquidation thresholds of the collateral’s underlying assets. At any point in time, a borrow position is characterized by its health factor Hf, a function for the total col- lateral and the total borrows which determines if a loan is undercollateralized: Hf = T otalCollateralET H∗La Q T otalBorrowsET H+T otalF eesET H when Hf < 1, a loan is considered undercollateralized and can be liquidated Further details on liquidation can be found in section 3.6. 1.2 Formal Definitions Variable Description T, current times- tamp Current number of seconds defined by block.timestamp.

When a user deposits in a specific reserve, he receives a corresponding amount of aTokens, tokens that map the liquidity deposited and accrue the interests of the deposited underlying assets. Atokens are minted upon deposit, their value increases until they are burned on redeem or liquidated. Whenever a user opens a borrow position, the tokens used as collateral are locked and cannot be transferred. Further details on the tokenization are in section 3.8. 2.4 Lending Pool Configurator The LendingPoolConfigurator provides main configuration functions for LendingPool and LendingPoolCore: • Reserve initialization • Reserve configuration • Enable/disable borrowing on a reserve • Enable/disable the usage of a specific reserve as collateral. The LendingPoolConfigurator contract will be integrated in Aave Protocol governance. 2.5 Interest Rate Strategy The InterestRateStrategy contract holds the information needed to update the interest rates of a specific reserve and implements the update of the interest rates. Every reserve has a specific InterestRateStrategy contract. Specifically, within the base strategy contract DefaultReserveInterestRateStrategy the following are defined: • Base variable borrow rate Rv0 • Interest rate slope below optimal utilisation Rslope1 • Interest rate slope beyond optimal utilisation Rslope2 The current variable borrow rate is: Rv = ( Rv0 + U Uoptimal Rslope1, if U ≤Uoptimal Rv0 + Rslope1 + U−Uoptimal 1−Uoptimal Rslope2, if U > Uoptimal This interest rate model allows for calibration of key interest rates: • At U = 0, Rv = Rv0 • At U = Uoptimal, Rv = Rv0 + Rslope1 • Above Uoptimal, the interest rate rises sharply to take into account the cost of capital.

The stable borrow rate follows the same model described in section 4.2. 2.6 Governance The rights of the protocol are controlled by the LEND token. Initially, the Aave Protocol will be launched with a decentralized on-chain governance based on the DAOStack framework which will evolve to a fully autonomous protocol. On-chain implies all votes are binding: actions that follow a vote are hard-coded and must be executed. To understand the scope of the governance it’s important to make the distinction: • The Aave Protocol is bound to evolve and will allow the creation of multiple lending pools with segregated liquidity, parameters, permissions, and type of assets. • The Aave Lending Pool is the first pool of the Aave protocol until the Pool Factory Update is released and anyone can create their own pool. Within the Aave Protocol, the governance will take place at two level : 1. The Protocol’s Governance voting is weighted by LEND for decisions related to protocol parameters and upgrades of the smart contract. It can be compared to MakerDAO’s governance where stakeholders vote on current and future parameters of the protocol. 2. The Pool’s Governance where your vote is weighted based on your share of pool liquidity expressed in aTokens. The votes cover pool specific parameters such as assets used as collateral or to be borrowed. Each Pool will have its own governance, under the umbrella of the Protocol’s Governance. More details on the Governance will be published in a Governance Proposal to the community. 3 The LendingPool Contract The actions implemented within LendingPool allow users to interact with the reserve. All the actions follow this specific sequence: Figure 5: The LendingPool Contract 3.1 Deposit The deposit action is the simplest one and does not have any particular state check. The sequence of action is: Figure 6: Deposit funds 3.2 Redeem The redeem action allows users to exchange an amount of aTokens for the underlying asset. The actual amount to redeem is calculated using the aToken/underlying exchange rate Ei in section 3.8. The action is defined as follows: Figure 7: Redeem funds 3.3 Borrow The borrow action transfers to the user a specific amount of underlying asset, in exchange of a collateral that remains locked. The flow of action can be described as follows: Figure 8: Borrow funds 3.4 Repay The repay action allows the user to repay completely or partially the borrowed amount plus the origination fee and the accrued interest. Figure 9: Repay a loan 3.5 Swap Rate The swap rate action allows a user with a borrow in progress to swap between variable and stable borrow rate. Figure 10: Swap Rate 3.6 Liquidation Call The liquidationcall contract allows any external actor to purchase part of a collateral at a discounted price. In case of a liquidation event, a maximum of 50% of the loan can be liquidated, which will bring the health factor back above 1.

Figure 11: Liquidation 3.7 Flash Loans The flash loan action will allow users to borrow from the reserves within a single transaction, as long as the user returns more liquidity that has been taken. Figure 12: Flash Loan Flash loans temporarily transfer the funds to a smart contract that respects the IFlashLoanEnabledContract.sol interface. The address of the contract is a parameter of the action. After the funds are transferred, the method executeOperation() is executed on the external contract. The contract can do whatever action is needed with the borrowed funds. After the method executeOperation() is completed, a check is performed to verify that the funds plus fee have been returned to the LendingPool contract. The fee is then accrued to the reserve, and the state of the reserve is updated. If less funds than what was borrowed have been returned to the reserve, the transaction is reverted. 3.8 Tokenization The Aave protocol implements a tokenization strategy for liquidity providers. Upon deposit, the depositor receives a corresponding amount of derivative tokens, called Aave Tokens (aTokens for short) that map 1:1 the underlying assets. The balance of aTokens of every depositor grows over time, driven by the perpetual accrual of interest of deposits. aTokens are fully ERC20 compliant. aTokens also natively implement the concept of interest rate redirection. Indeed, the value accrued over time by the borrowers’ interest rate payments is distinct from the principal value. Once there is a balance of aTokens, the accrued value can be redirected to any address, effectively splitting the balance and the generated interest. We call the continuous flow of accumulated interest over time the interest stream. To implement this tokenization strategy, Aave introduced the following concepts in the aToken contract: 1. User x balance index It x: Is the value of the reserve normalized income It x at the moment of execution of the last action by the user. 2. Principal balance Bp: Is the balance stored in the balances mapping of the ERC20 aToken contract. The principal balance gets updated on every action that the user executes on the aToken contract (deposit, redeem, transfer, liquidation, interest rate redirection) 3. Redirection address Ar: When a user decides to redirect his interest stream to another address, a new redirection address Ar is provided. If no redirection of the interest stream is performed, Ar is 0 4. Redirected Balance Bx r : Whenever a user redirects his interest stream, the balance of user redirecting is added to the redirected balance Br of the address specified by Br. Defined as follows: Bx r = P X Bp Where X is the set of users redirecting the interest stream to the user x The redirected balance decreases whenever a user x0 ∈X redeems or transfers his aTokens to another user that is not redirecting to x. 5. Current balance Bc: Is the balance returned by the balanceOf() function of the aToken contract. Defined as follows: Bx c = 0, if Bx p = 0 and Bx r = 0 Bx p + Bx r ( In Ix −1), if Ar <> 0 Bx p In Ix + Bx r ( In Ix −1), if Ar = 0 3.8.1 Limitations'},\n",

It’s impossible to transfer the whole balance at once: Given the perpetual accrual of the interest rate, there is no way to specify the exact amount to transfer, since the interest will keep accruing even while the transfer transaction is being confirmed. This means that having exactly 0 balance after a transfer is impossible, rather, a very small balance (dust balance) will be left to the from account executing the transfer. Note that this could have been avoided by adding specific logic to handle this particular edge case, but this would have meant adding a non standard behavior to the ERC20 transfer function, and for this reason we avoided it. Even though this is not a relevant issue, it’s important to note that is possible to completely clear the remaining balance by either 1. execute another transfer, which will most likely transfer the remaining dust balance as it would be too small to accrue interest in a reasonably short amount of time, or 2. redeem the dust balance and transfer the underlying asset. 2. Interest stream can only be redirected if there is a principal balance: This means that only accounts that have a principal balance Bp can redirect their interest. If users redeem or transfer everything, their interest redirection is reset. As a side effect of this, interest generated only by the redirected balance Br cannot be redirected. 4 Stable Rate Theory The following chapter explains how the stable rates are applied to the system and the limitations. Implementation of a fixed rate model on top of a pool is complicated. Indeed, fixed rates are hard to handle algorithmically, as the cost of borrowing money varies with market conditions and the liquidity available. There might therefore be situations (sudden market changes, bank runs ...) in which handling stable rate borrow positions would need using specific heuristics based on time or economical constraints. Following this reasoning, we identified two possible ways of handling fixed rates: 1. Imposing time constraints: fixed rates might work perfectly fine in a time constrained fashion. If a loan has a stable duration, it should survive extreme market conditions, as the borrower must repay at the end of the loan period. Unfortunately, time constrained fixed rate loans aren’t suitable for our specific use case of open ended loan. It would require a certain degree of UX friction where users would need to create and handle multiple loans with different times constraints. 2. Imposing rates constraints: An interest rate calculated at the beginning of a loan might be impacted by market conditions, keeping it from staying fixed. If the rate diverges too much from the market, it can be readjusted. This would not be a pure fixed rate, open term loan - as the rate might vary throughout the loan duration - yet users will experience actual fixed rates during specific'},\n",

If the rate diverges too much from the market, it can be readjusted. This would not be a pure fixed rate, open term loan - as the rate might vary throughout the loan duration - yet users will experience actual fixed rates during specific time periods, or when there is enough liquidity available. This particular implementation has been chosen to be integrated into Aave’s Protocol under the name stable rate. 4.1 Lending Rate Oracle Figure 13: Lending Rate Oracle The first component to be integrated into the Protocol protocol is a Lending Rate Oracle, which will provide information to the contracts on the actual market rates that other lending platforms, both centralized and decentralized, are providing. The average market lending rate Mr is defined for i platforms with P i r the lending rate and P i v the borrowing volume: Mr = Pn i=1 P i rP i v Pn i=1 P iv The market rate will be updated daily, initially by Aave. 4.2 Current Stable Borrow Rate Rs The current stable borrow rate is calculated as follows: Rt s = ( Mr + U Uoptimal Rslope1, if U ≤Uoptimal Mr + Rslope1 + U−Uoptimal 1−Uoptimal Rslope2, if U > Uoptimal With: - Mr the average market lending rate. - Rslope1 the interest rate slope below Uoptimal, increases the rate as U increases. - Rslope2 the interest rate slope beyond Uoptimal, increases as the difference between U and Uoptimal increases. - U is the utilization rate. Note: Rs does NOT impact existing stable rates positions - this is applied only to new opened positions. 4.3 Limitations on Stable Rate Positions To avoid abuses on stable rate loans, the following limitations have been applied to the stable rate borrowing model: 1. Users cannot deposit as collateral more liquidity than what they are trying to borrow. Eg. a user deposits 10 million DAI collateral, tries to borrow 1 million DAI. This is to prevent the following attack vector: Given: Bs = 18%APR, Mr = 9%APR, Rl = 12%APR Users might try to artificially lower Bs to the value of Mr by depositing a huge amount of liquidity which would cause Bs to drop, then borrow from the same liquidity at a lower rate, withdraw the liquidity previously deposited to cause Bs and the liquidity rate Rl to raise again; then finally deposit the amount borrowed to earn interest on the previously borrowed funds. Although this attack can still be carried out using multiple accounts, this particular constraint makes the attack more complicated as it requires more money (and a different collateral currency). This works well in combination with the interest rate rebalancing in the next section. 2. Borrowers will only be able to borrow up to Tr of the available liquidity at the current borrow rate. So, for every specific value of Bs, there is only up to Tr of liquidity available for a single borrower. This is to avoid that a specific borrower would borrow too much available liquidity at a too competitive rate. 4.4 Stable Rate Rebalancing The last and perhaps most important constraint of the stable rate model is the rate rebalancing. This is to work around changes in market conditions or increased cost of money within the pool. The stable rate'},\n",

So, for every specific value of Bs, there is only up to Tr of liquidity available for a single borrower. This is to avoid that a specific borrower would borrow too much available liquidity at a too competitive rate. 4.4 Stable Rate Rebalancing The last and perhaps most important constraint of the stable rate model is the rate rebalancing. This is to work around changes in market conditions or increased cost of money within the pool. The stable rate rebalancing will happen in two specific situations: 1. Rebalancing up. The stable rate of a user x is rebalanced to the most recent value of Bs when a user could earn interest by borrowing: Bx s < Rl with Bx s the stable borrow rate of user x 2. Rebalancing down. The stable rate of a user x is rebalanced to the most recent value of Bs, if: Bx s > Bs(1 + ∆Bs) with ∆Bs a rate delta established by governance which defines the window above Bs to rebalance interest rates. If a user pays too much interest beyond that range, the rate is balanced down. 4.5 The Rebalancing Process The LendingPool contract exposes a function rebalanceStableBorrowRate(address reserve, address user) which allows to rebalance the stable rate interest of a specific user. Anybody can call this function: however, there isn’t any direct incentive for the caller to rebalance the rate of a specific user. For this reason, Aave will provide an agent that will periodically monitor all the stable rates positions and rebalance the ones that will be deemed necessary. The rebalance strategy will be decided offchain by the agent, this means that users that satisfy the rebalance conditions may not be rebalanced immediately. Since those conditions depend on the liquidity avail- able and the state of market, there might be some transitory situations in which an immediate rebalance is not needed. This does not add any element of centralization to the protocol. Even if the agent stops working, anybody can call the rebalance function of the LendingPool contract. Although there isn’t any direct incentive in doing it (“why should I do it?”) there is an indirect incentive for the ecosystem. In fact, even if the agent should cease to exist, depositors might still want to trigger a rebalance up of the lowest borrow rate positions, to increase the liquidity rate and/or force borrowers to close up their positions, increasing the available liquidity. In case of a rescale down, instead, borrowers have a direct incentive in performing a rebalance of their positions to lower the interest rate. The following flowchart explains the sequence of actions of the function rebalanceStableBorrowRate(). The compounded balance that is accumulated until the instant at which the rebalance happens, is not affected by the rebalance. Figure 14: Rebalancing 5 Conclusion The Aave Protocol relies on a lending pool model to offer high liquidity. Loans are backed by collateral and represented by aTokens, derivative tokens which accrue the interests. The parameters such as interest rate and Loan-To-Value are token specific. Aave improves Decentralized Finance’s current offering, bringing two key innovations to the lending ecosystem: • Stable Rates to help borrowers’ financial planning; • Flash Loans to borrow without collateral during a single transaction.

       "  'text': \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System Satoshi Nakamoto [EMAIL] www.bitcoin.org Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. 1. Introduction Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non- reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party. What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes. 2. Transactions We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership. The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend the coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending.

The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend the coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending. After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent. The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank. We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier transactions. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care about later attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions. In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly announced [1], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received. 3. Timestamp Server The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server. A timestamp server works by taking a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a newspaper or Usenet post [2-5]. The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the time, obviously, in order to get into the hash. Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it. Block Item Item Hash Block Item Item Hash Transaction Owner 1's Public Key Owner 0's Signature Hash Transaction Owner 2's Public Key Owner 1's Signature Hash Verify Transaction Owner 3's Public Key Owner 2's Signature Hash Verify Owner 2's Private Key Owner 1's Private Key Sign Sign Owner 3's Private Key 4. Proof-of-Work To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof- of-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts. The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash. For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits. Once the CPU effort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed without redoing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block would include redoing all the blocks after it. The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it.

If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added. To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases. 5. Network The steps to run the network are as follows: 1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes. 2) Each node collects new transactions into a block. 3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block. 4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes. 5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent. 6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash. Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received, but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proof- of-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other branch will then switch to the longer one. Block Prev Hash Nonce Tx Tx Block Prev Hash Nonce Tx Tx New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes. As long as they reach many nodes, they will get into a block before long. Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped messages. If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and realizes it missed one. 6. Incentive By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them. The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended. The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction.

The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free. The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth. 7. Reclaiming Disk Space Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored. A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.

Simplified Payment Verification It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it. As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency.

Combining and Splitting Value Although it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a separate transaction for every cent in a transfer. To allow value to be split and combined, transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs. Normally there will be either a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two outputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender. It should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those transactions depend on many more, is not a problem here. There is never the need to extract a complete standalone copy of a transaction\\'s history.

Privacy The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the \"tape\", is made public, but without telling who the parties were. As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner. 11. Calculations We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent. The race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial Random Walk. The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its lead by +1, and the failure event is the attacker\\'s chain being extended by one block, reducing the gap by -1.

The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's Ruin problem. Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit starts at a deficit and plays potentially an infinite number of trials to try to reach breakeven. We can calculate the probability he ever reaches breakeven, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows [8]: p = probability an honest node finds the next block q = probability the attacker finds the next block qz = probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind q z={ if p≤q q/ p z if pq} Identities Transactions Trusted Third Party Counterparty Public Identities Transactions Public New Privacy Model Traditional Privacy Model Given our assumption that p > q, the probability drops exponentially as the number of blocks the attacker has to catch up with increases. With the odds against him, if he doesn't make a lucky lunge forward early on, his chances become vanishingly small as he falls further behind. We now consider how long the recipient of a new transaction needs to wait before being sufficiently certain the sender can't change the transaction. We assume the sender is an attacker who wants to make the recipient believe he paid him for a while, then switch it to pay back to himself after some time has passed. The receiver will be alerted when that happens, but the sender hopes it will be too late. The receiver generates a new key pair and gives the public key to the sender shortly before signing. This prevents the sender from preparing a chain of blocks ahead of time by working on it continuously until he is lucky enough to get far enough ahead, then executing the transaction at that moment. Once the transaction is sent, the dishonest sender starts working in secret on a parallel chain containing an alternate version of his transaction. The recipient waits until the transaction has been added to a block and z blocks have been linked after it. He doesn't know the exact amount of progress the attacker has made, but assuming the honest blocks took the average expected time per block, the attacker's potential progress will be a Poisson distribution with expected value: =z q p To get the probability the attacker could still catch up now, we multiply the Poisson density for each amount of progress he could have made by the probability he could catch up from that point: ∑ k=0 ∞ ke − k! ⋅{ q/ p z−k if k≤z if kz} Rearranging to avoid summing the infinite tail of the distribution... 1−∑ k=0 z k e − k! 1−q/ p z−k Converting to C code... #include <math.h> double AttackerSuccessProbability(double q, int z) { double p = 1.0 - q; double lambda = z * (q / p); double sum = 1.0; int i, k; for (k = 0; k <= z; k++) { double poisson = exp(-lambda); for (i = 1; i <= k; i++) poisson *= lambda / i; sum -= poisson * (1 -\"},\n",

We started with the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending. To solve this, we proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power. The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism. References [1] W. Dai, \"b-money,\" http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt, 1998. [2] H. Massias, X.S. Avila, and J.-J.

Abstract In this whitepaper, we articulate a vision for the evolution of Chainlink be- yond its initial conception in the original Chainlink whitepaper. We foresee an increasingly expansive role for oracle networks, one in which they comple- ment and enhance existing and new blockchains by providing fast, reliable, and confidentiality-preserving universal connectivity and off-chain computation for smart contracts. The foundation of our plan is what we call Decentralized Oracle Networks, or DONs for short. A DON is a network maintained by a committee of Chainlink nodes. It supports any of an unlimited range of oracle functions chosen for deployment by the committee. A DON thus acts as a powerful abstraction layer, offering interfaces for smart contracts to extensive off-chain resources and highly efficient yet decentralized off-chain computing resources within the DON itself. With DONs as a springboard, Chainlink plans to focus on advances in seven key areas: • Hybrid smart contracts: Offering a powerful, general framework for aug- menting existing smart contract capabilities by securely composing on-chain and off-chain computing resources into what we call hybrid smart contracts. • Abstracting away complexity: Presenting developers and users with simple functionality eliminates the need for familiarity with complex underlying protocols and system boundaries. • Scaling: Ensuring that oracle services achieve the latencies and throughputs demanded by high-performance decentralized systems. • Confidentiality: Enabling next-generation systems that combine blockchains’ innate transparency with strong new confidentiality protections for sensitive data. • Order-fairness for transactions: Supporting transaction sequencing in ways that are fair for end users and prevent front-running and other attacks by bots and exploitative miners. • Trust-minimization: Creating a highly trustworthy layer of support for smart contracts and other oracle-dependent systems by means of decen- tralization, strong anchoring in high-security blockchains, cryptographic techniques, and cryptoeconomic guarantees. • Incentive-based (cryptoeconomic) security: Rigorously designing and ro- bustly deploying mechanisms that ensure nodes in DONs have strong eco- nomic incentives to behave reliably and correctly, even in the face of well- resourced adversaries. We present preliminary and ongoing innovations by the Chainlink community in each of these areas, providing a picture of the broadening and increasingly powerful capabilities planned for the Chainlink network.

In short, an oracle can and will need to be a general-purpose, bidirectional, compute-enabled interface between and among on- chain and off-chain systems. Oracles’ role in the blockchain ecosystem is to enhance the performance, functionality, and interoperability of smart contracts so that they can bring new trust models and transparency to a multiplicity of industries. This transfor- mation will come about through broadening use of hybrid smart contracts, which fuse blockchains’ special properties with the unique capabilities of off-chain systems such as oracle networks and thereby achieve far greater reach and power than on-chain systems in isolation. In this whitepaper, we articulate a vision for what we call Chainlink 2.0, an evo- lution of Chainlink beyond its initial conception in the original Chainlink whitepa- per [98]. We foresee an increasingly expansive role for oracle networks, one in which they complement and enhance existing and new blockchains by providing fast, reli- able, and confidentiality-preserving universal connectivity and computation for hybrid smart contracts. We believe that oracle networks will even evolve to become utilities for exporting high-integrity blockchain-grade data to systems beyond the blockchain ecosystem. Today, Chainlink nodes run by a diverse set of entities come together in oracle net- works to relay data to smart contracts in what are known as reports. We can view such oracle nodes as a committee similar to that in a classical-consensus blockchain [72], but with the goal of supporting existing blockchains, rather than providing freestand- ing functionality. With verifiable random functions (VRF) and Off-Chain Reporting (OCR), Chainlink is already evolving toward a general-purpose framework and infras- tructure for providing the computational resources that smart contracts require for advanced functionality. The foundation of our plan for Chainlink 2.0 is what we call Decentralized Oracle Networks, or DONs for short. Since we introduced the term “oracle network” in the original Chainlink whitepaper [98], oracles have developed ever richer functionality and breadth of application. In this paper, we offer a fresh definition of the term according to our future vision for the Chainlink ecosystem. In this view, a DON is a network maintained by a committee of Chainlink nodes. Rooted in a consensus protocol, it supports any of an unlimited range of oracle functions chosen for deployment by the committee. A DON thus acts as a blockchain abstraction layer, providing interfaces to off-chain resources for both smart contracts and other systems. It also provides access to highly efficient yet decentralized off-chain computing resources. In general, a DON supports operations on a main chain. Its goal is to enable secure and flexi- ble hybrid smart contracts, which combine on-chain and off-chain computation with connection to external resources. We emphasize that even with the use of committees in DONs, Chainlink itself remains inherently permissionless. DONs act as the foundation of a permissionless framework in which nodes can come together to implement custom oracle networks with their own regimes for node inclusion, which may be permissioned or permissionless. With DONs as a foundation, we plan to focus in Chainlink 2.0 on advances in seven key areas: hybrid smart contracts, abstracting away complexity, scaling, confidential- ity, order-fairness for transactions, trust minimization, and incentive-based (cryptoeco- nomic) security.

In this paper introduction, we present an overview of Decentralized Oracle Networks in Section 1.1 and then our seven key areas of innovation in Sec- tion 1.2. We describe the organization of the rest of this paper in Section 1.3. 1.1 Decentralized Oracle Networks Decentralized Oracle Networks are designed to enhance and extend the capabilities of smart contracts on a target blockchain or main chain through functions that are not available natively. They do so by providing the three basic resources found in computing systems: networking, storage, and computation. A DON aims to offer these resources with strong confidentiality, integrity, and availability properties,1 as well as accountability. DONs are formed by committees of oracle nodes that cooperate to fulfill a specific job or choose to establish a long-lived relationship in order to provide persistent services to clients. DONs are designed in a blockchain-agnostic way. They promise to serve as a powerful and flexible tool for application developers to create off-chain support for their smart contracts on any supported main chain. Two types of functionalities realize the capabilities of a DON: executables and adapters. Executables are programs that run continuously and in a decentralized man- ner on the DON. While they do not directly store main-chain assets, they have im- portant benefits, including high performance and the ability to perform confidential computation. Executables run autonomously on a DON and perform deterministic operations. They work in hand with adapters that link the DON to external resources and may be called by executables. Adapters, as we envision them for DONs, are a generalization of the external adapters in Chainlink today. While existing adapters typically only fetch data from data sources, adapters may operate bidirectionally; in DONs, they may additionally leverage joint computation by DON nodes to achieve additional features, such as encrypting reports for privacy-preserving consumption by an executable. To provide a sense of a DON’s basic operation, Fig. 1 shows conceptually how a DON might be used to send reports to a blockchain and thus achieve traditional, exist- ing oracle functionality. DONs can provide many additional features, however, beyond 1The “CIA triad” of information security [123, p. 26, §2.3.5]. Chainlink’s existing networks. For example, within the general structure of Fig. 1, the executable could record fetched asset-price data on the DON, using such data to compute, e.g., a trailing average for its reports. Figure 1: Conceptual figure showing as an example how a Decentralized Oracle Net- work can realize basic oracle functionality, i.e., relay off-chain data to a contract. An executable uses adapters to fetch off-chain data, which it computes on, sending output over another adapter to a target blockchain. (Adapters are initiated by code in the DON, represented by small blue boxes; arrows show the direction of data flow for this particular example.) The executable can additionally read and write to local DON storage to keep state and/or communicate with other executables. Flexible network- ing, computation, and storage in DONs, all represented here, enable a host of novel applications. A major benefit of DONs is their ability to bootstrap new blockchain services.

We give a number of examples of such applications in Section 4. In Section 3, we provide more details on DONs, describing their capabilities in terms of the interface they present to developers and users. 1.2 Seven Key Design Goals Here we briefly review the seven key focuses enumerated above for the evolution of Chainlink, namely: Hybrid smart contracts: Central to our vision for Chainlink is the idea of securely combining on-chain and off-chain components in smart contracts. We refer to contracts realizing this idea as hybrid smart contracts or hybrid contracts.2 Blockchains are and will continue to play two critical roles in decentralized-service ecosystems: They are both the loci where cryptocurrency ownership is represented and robust anchors for decentralized services. Smart contracts must therefore be repre- sented or executed on chain, but their on-chain capabilities are severely limited. Purely on-chain contract code is slow, expensive, and insular, unable to benefit from real-world data and a variety of functionalities that are inherently unachievable on chain, includ- ing various forms of confidential computation, generation of (pseudo)randomness secure against miner / validator manipulation, etc. For smart contracts to realize their full potential therefore requires smart contracts to be architected with two parts: an on-chain part (which we typically denote by SC) and an off-chain part, an executable running on a DON (which we typically denote by exec). The goal is to achieve a secure composition of on-chain functionality with the multiplicity of off-chain services that DONs aim to provide. Together, the two parts make up a hybrid contract. We present the idea conceptually in Fig. 2. Already today, Chainlink services3 such as data feeds and VRFs are enabling otherwise unachievable smart contract applications, ranging from DeFi to fairly generated NFTs to decentral- ized insurance, as first steps toward a more general framework. As Chainlink services expand and grow more performant according to our vision in this whitepaper, so too will the power of smart contract systems across all blockchains. Our other six key focuses in this whitepaper may be viewed as acting in the service of the first, overarching one of hybrid contracts. These focuses involve removing visible complexity from hybrid contracts, creating additional off-chain services that enable the construction of ever more capable hybrid contracts, and, in the case of trust minimiza- tion, bolstering the security properties achieved by hybrid contracts. We leave the idea of hybrid contracts implicit throughout much of the paper, but any combination of MAINCHAIN logic with a DON may be viewed as a hybrid contract. Abstracting away complexity: DONs are designed to make use of decentralized systems easy for developers and users by abstracting away the often complex machinery behind DONs’ powerful and flexible array of services. Existing Chainlink services already have this feature. For example, data feeds in Chainlink today present on- chain interfaces that do not require developers to concern themselves with protocol- level details, such as the means by which OCR enforces consensus reporting among a 2The'},\n",

They are offered by the numerous node operators composed into various oracle networks across the ecosystem. Figure 2: Conceptual figure depicting on-chain / off-chain contract composition. A hybrid smart contract 3⃝consists of two complementary components: an on-chain component SC 1⃝, resident on a blockchain, and an off-chain component exec 2⃝that executes on a DON. The DON serves as a bridge between the two components as well as connecting the hybrid contract with off-chain resources such as web services, other blockchains, decentralized storage, etc. decentralized set of nodes. DONs go a step further in the sense that they expand the range of services for which Chainlink can offer developers an abstraction layer with accompanying streamlined interfaces for high-level services. We present several application examples in Section 4 that highlight this approach. We envision enterprises, for instance, using DONs as a form of secure middleware to connect their legacy systems to blockchains. (See Section 4.2.) This use of DONs ab- stracts away the complexity of general blockchain dynamics (fees, reorgs, etc.). It also abstracts away the features of specific blockchains, thereby enabling enterprises to con- nect their existing systems to an ever-broadening array of blockchain systems without a need for specialized expertise in these systems or, more generally, in decentralized- systems development. Ultimately, our ambition is to push the degree of abstraction achieved by Chainlink to the point of implementing what we refer to as a decentralized metalayer. Such a layer would abstract away the on-chain / off-chain distinction for all classes of developers and users of DApps, allowing seamless creation and use of decentralized services. To simplify the development process, developers could specify DApp functional- ity in the metalayer as a virtual application in a unified machine model. They could then use a decentralized-metalayer compiler to instantiate the DApp automatically as a set of interoperating decentralized functionalities spanning blockchains, DONs, and external services. (One of these external services could be an enterprise system, mak- ing the metalayer useful for applications involving legacy enterprise systems.) Such compilation is akin to how modern compilers and software-development kits (SDKs) support generalist programmers in using the full potential of heterogeneous hardware architectures consisting of a general-purpose CPU and specialized hardware like GPUs, machine-learning accelerators, or trusted enclaves. Fig. 3 presents this idea at a con- ceptual level. Hybrid smart contracts are a first step along the way to this vision and to a con- cept we call meta contracts. Meta contracts are applications coded on a decentralized metalayer and implicitly encompass on-chain logic (smart contracts), as well as off- chain computation and connectivity among various blockchains and existing off-chain services.

Given the need for language and compiler support, new security models, and conceptual and technical harmonization of disparate technologies, however, realization of a true decentralized metalayer is an ambitious goal to which we aspire over a long time horizon. It is nonetheless a helpful ideal model to keep in mind while reading this paper, not detailed here, but something we plan to focus on in our future work on Chainlink. Scaling: A goal of preeminent importance in our evolving designs is enabling the Chainlink network to meet the growing scaling needs of the blockchain ecosystem. With network congestion becoming a recurring problem in existing permissionless blockchains [86], new and more performant blockchain designs are coming into use, e.g., [103, 120, 203], as well as complementary layer-2 scaling technologies, e.g., [5, 12, 121, 141, 169, 186, 187]. Oracle services must achieve latencies and throughputs that meet the performance demands of these systems while minimizing on-chain fees (e.g., gas costs) for contract operators and ordinary users alike. With DONs, Chainlink functionality aims to go further and deliver performance high enough for purely web- based systems. DONs derive much of their performance gain from their use of fast, committee- based or permissionless consensus protocols, which they combine with the blockchains they support. We expect many DONs with different configurations to run in paral- lel; different DApps and users can navigate tradeoffs in underlying consensus choices according to their application requirements. DONs may be viewed in effect as layer-2 technologies. We expect that among other services, DONs will support the Transaction Execution Framework (TEF), which facilitates efficient integration of DONs and thus oracles with other high-performance layer-2 systems-e.g., rollups, systems which bundle transactions offchain to achieve performance improvements. We introduce the TEF in Section 6. Figure 3: Conceptual figure showing ideal realization of a decentralized metalayer. For ease of development, a developer specifies a DApp, highlighted in pink, as a virtual application in a unified machine model. A decentralized-metalayer compiler automati- cally generates corresponding interoperating functionalities: smart contracts (denoted by SC), logic (denoted by exec) on DONs, adapters connecting to target external ser- vices, and so forth, as indicated in yellow highlight. Fig. 4 shows conceptually how DONs improve blockchain (smart contract) scaling by concentrating transaction and oracle-report processing offchain, rather than on chain. This shift in the main locus of computation reduces transaction latency and fees while boosting transaction throughput. Confidentiality: Blockchains provide unprecedented transparency for smart con- tracts and the applications they realize. But there is a basic tension between trans- parency and confidentiality. Today, for example, users’ decentralized exchange trans- Figure 4: Conceptual figure showing how Decentralized Oracle Networks improve the scaling of blockchain-enabled smart contracts.

The DON, highlighted in yellow, is thus the main locus for transaction processing. actions are recorded on chain, making it easy to monitor exchange behavior, but also making users’ financial transactions publicly visible. Similarly, data relayed to smart contracts remains on chain. This makes such data conveniently auditable, but acts as a disincentive for data providers wishing to furnish smart contracts with sensitive or proprietary data. We believe that oracle networks will play a pivotal role in catalyzing next-generation systems that combine blockchains’ innate transparency with new confidentiality pro- tections. In this paper, we show how they will do so using three main approaches: • Confidentiality-preserving adapters: Two technologies with planned deployment in Chainlink’s networks, DECO [234] and Town Crier [233], enable oracle nodes to retrieve data from off-chain systems in ways that protect user privacy and data confidentiality. They will play a key role in the design of adapters for DONs. (See Section 3.6.2 for details on these two technologies.) • Confidential computation: DONs can simply conceal their computation from re- lying blockchains. Using secure multi-party computation and/or trusted execu- tion environments, stronger confidentiality is also possible in which DON nodes compute over data into which they themselves do not have visibility. • Support for confidential layer-2 systems: The TEF is designed to support a va- riety of layer-2 systems, many of which use zero-knowledge proofs to provide various forms of transaction confidentiality. We discuss these approaches in Section 3 (with additional details in Section 6, Ap- pendix B.1, and Appendix B.2). Fig. 5 presents a conceptual view of how sensitive data might flow from exter- nal sources to a smart contract by means of confidentiality-preserving adapters and confidential computation in a DON. Figure 5: Conceptual diagram of confidentiality-preserving operations in a DON on sensitive data (highlighted in yellow). Sensitive source data (black circles) in web servers is extracted to the DON using confidentiality-preserving adapters (blue, double- arrowed lines). The DON receives derived data (hollow circles) from these adapters- the result of applying either a function or, e.g., secret-sharing, to the sensitive source data. An executable on the DON may apply confidential computation to derived data to construct a report (double circle), which it sends over an adapter to the blockchain. We believe that powerful tools for handling confidential data will open up a whole range of applications. Among these are private decentralized (and centralized) fi- nance, decentralized identity, credit-based on-chain lending, and more efficient and user-friendly know-your-customer and accreditation protocols, as we discuss in Sec- tion 4.

Order-fairness for transactions: Today’s blockchain designs have a dirty little open secret: They are ephemerally centralized. Miners and validators can order trans- actions however they choose. Transaction order can also be manipulated by users as a function of the network fees they pay (e.g., gas prices in Ethereum) and to some extent by taking advantage of fast network connections. Such manipulation can, for example, take the form of front-running, in which a strategic actor such as a miner observes a user’s transaction and inserts its own exploitative transaction into an earlier position in the same block-effectively stealing money from the user by leveraging ad- vance knowledge of the user’s transaction. For example, a bot may place a buy order before a user’s. It can then take advantage of the asset price increase induced by the user’s trade. Front-running by some bots that harms ordinary users-analogous to high-frequency trading on Wall Street-is already prevalent and well documented [90], as are related attacks such as back-running [159] and automated transaction mimicking [195]. Pro- posals to systematize order exploitation by miners have even surfaced recently [110]. Layer-2 technologies such as rollups don’t solve the problem, but merely re-centralize ordering, placing it in the hands of the entity that creates a rollup. One of our goals is to introduce into Chainlink a service called Fair Sequencing Services (FSS) [137]. FSS helps smart contract designers ensure fair ordering for their transactions and avoid front-running, back-running, and related attacks on user trans- actions as well as other types of transactions, such as oracle report transmission. FSS enables a DON to implement ideas such as the rigorous, temporal notion of order- fairness introduced in [144]. As an incidental benefit, FSS can also lower users’ network fees (e.g., gas costs). Briefly, in FSS, transactions pass through the DON, rather than propagating di- rectly to a target smart contract. The DON orders the transactions and then forwards them to the contract. Figure 6: Example of how FSS is beneficial. Fig. A ⃝shows how a miner, exploiting its centralized power to order transactions, may swap a pair of transactions: transaction 1⃝ arrives before 2⃝, but the miner instead sequences it after 2⃝. In contrast, Fig. B⃝shows how a DON decentralizes the ordering process among DON nodes. If a quorum of honest nodes receive 1⃝before 2⃝, the FSS causes 1⃝to appear before 2⃝on chain- preventing miner reordering by attaching contract-enforceable sequence numbers. Fig. 6 compares standard mining with FSS. It shows how in standard mining, the process of transaction ordering is centralized with the miner and thus subject to manipulation, such as reordering a pair of transactions with respect to their arrival times. In contrast, in FSS, the process is decentralized among DON nodes. Assuming a quorum of honest nodes, FSS helps enforce policies such as temporal ordering of transactions, reducing opportunities for manipulation by miners and other entities. Additionally, since users need not compete for preferential ordering based on gas price, they can pay relatively low gas prices (while transactions from the DON can be batched for gas savings). Trust minimization: Our general aim in the design of DONs is to facilitate a highly trustworthy layer of support for smart contracts and other oracle-dependent systems by means of decentralization, cryptographic tools, and cryptoeconomic guarantees.

A DON itself is decentralized, and users can choose from any available DON that supports the main chain on which they wish to operate or spawn additional DONs with committees of nodes they trust. For some applications, however, particularly smart contracts, Chainlink users may favor a trust model that treats the main chain supported by a DON as more trustworthy than the DON itself. For such users, we already have or plan to incorporate into the architecture of the Chainlink network a number of mechanisms that enable contracts on a main chain to strengthen the security assurances provided by DONs, while at the same time also enforcing protections against the possibility of corrupted data sources such as the web servers from which the DON obtains data. We describe these mechanisms in Section 7. They fall under five main headings: • Data-source authentication: Tools that enable data providers to digitally sign their data and thereby strengthen the chain of custody between the origin and relying contract. • DON minority reports: Flags issued by a minority subset of DON nodes that observes majority malfeasance in the DON. • Guard rails: Logic on a main chain that detects anomalous conditions and pauses or halts contract execution (or invokes other remediations). • Trust-minimized governance: Use of gradual-release updates to facilitate com- munity inspection, as well as decentralized emergency interventions for rapid response to system failures. • Decentralized entity authentication: Use of public-key infrastructure (PKI) to identify entities in the Chainlink network. Fig. 7 presents a conceptual schematic of our trust-minimization goals. Incentive-based (cryptoeconomic) security: Decentralization of report genera- tion across oracle nodes helps ensure security even when some nodes are corrupted. Figure 7: Conceptual depiction of Chainlink’s trust-minimization goal, which is to minimize users’ need for correct behavior of the DON and data sources such as web servers. Yellow highlights in the figure indicate trust-minimization loci: the DON and individual or minority sets of web servers. Pink highlights indicate system components that are highly trustworthy by assumption: contracts on the blockchain and a majority of web servers, i.e., web servers in the aggregate. Equally important, though, is ensuring that nodes have a financial incentive to be- have correctly. Staking, i.e., requiring nodes to provide deposits of LINK and slashing (confiscating) these deposits in case of misbehavior, will play a key role in Chain- link. It is an important incentive design already used in a number of blockchains, e.g., [81, 103, 120, 204]. Staking in Chainlink, however, looks very different from staking in standalone blockchains. Staking in blockchains aims to prevent attacks on consensus. It has a different goal in Chainlink: to ensure timely delivery of correct oracle reports. A well- designed staking system for an oracle network should render attacks such as bribery unprofitable for an adversary, even when the target is a smart contract with high monetary value. In this paper, we present a general approach to staking in Chainlink with three key innovations: 1. A powerful adversarial model that encompasses attacks overlooked in existing approaches.

This is a form of bribery that determines which nodes receive bribes on a conditional basis, e.g., offers guaranteed bribes in advance to nodes that a staking mechanism selects at random for particular roles (such as triggering report adjudication). 2. Super-linear staking impact, meaning informally that to be successful, an ad- versary must have a budget $B greater than the combined deposits of all oracle nodes. More precisely, we mean that as a function of n, $B(n) ≫$dn in a network of n oracle nodes each with a fixed deposit amount $d (more formally, $B(n) is asymptotically larger in n than $dn). Fig. 8 gives a conceptual view of this property. 3. The Implicit-Incentive Framework (IIF), an incentive model we have devised to encompass empirically measurable incentives beyond explicit deposited staking funds, including nodes’ future fee opportunities. The IIF extends the notion of stake beyond explicit node deposits. Figure 8: Conceptual diagram depicting super-linear scaling in Chainlink staking. The bribe $B(n) required by an adversary grows faster in n than the combined deposits $dn of all oracle nodes. We show how the IIF and super-linear staking impact together induce what we call a virtuous cycle of economic security for oracle networks. When new users enter the system, increasing potential future earnings from running Chainlink nodes, the marginal cost of economic security drops for current and future users. In a regime of elastic demand, this diminished cost incentivizes additional users to make use of the network, continuously perpetuating adoption in an ongoing virtuous cycle. Note: While this whitepaper outlines important elements of our vision for the evolu- tion of Chainlink, it is informal and includes few detailed technical specifics. We plan to release focused technical papers on additional features and approaches as they evolve. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that many elements of the vision presented here (scaling improvements, confidentiality technologies, FSS, etc.) can and will be deployed in preliminary form even before advanced DONs become a basic feature of Chainlink. 1.3 Organization of this Paper We present our security model and notation in Section 2 and outline the Decentralized Oracle Network API in Section 3.

We discuss some considerations bearing on committee selection for DONs in Appendix F. Security Model and Goals A Decentralized Oracle Network is a distinct distributed system that we expect will initially be implemented typically-although not necessarily-by a committee-based consensus protocol and run by a set of oracle nodes. A DON is designed primarily to augment the capabilities of a smart contract on a main chain with oracle reports and other services, but it can provide those same supporting services to other non- blockchain systems, and thus need not be associated with a particular main chain. The model and properties we consider are therefore largely independent of the use of the particular applications of a DON. 2.1 Current Architectural Model It is important to emphasize that Chainlink today is not a monolithic service, but rather a permissionless framework within which it is possible to launch distinct, independent networks of oracle nodes [77]. Networks have heterogeneous sets of node operators and designs. They may also differ in terms of the types of services they provide, which can include, e.g., data feeds, Proof of Reserves, verifiable randomness, and so forth. Other differences can include the degree of decentralization, size of the network in terms of locked value it supports, and various service-level parameters, such as data frequency and accuracy. Chainlink’s permissionless model encourages the growth of an ecosystem in which providers specialize in the services they are best able to furnish to the community. This model is likely to result in lower costs to users and higher service quality than a model that requires all nodes and networks to provide a full range of services, an approach that can easily devolve into system-wide adoption of the services representing the least common denominator of resources available to nodes. As Chainlink evolves toward DON-based designs in Chainlink 2.0, we continue to support the model of a permissionless, open framework, keeping in view the goal of providing users with a range of service choices that globally result in the best match with particular application requirements. 2.2 Consensus Assumptions We use the term Decentralized Oracle Network to encompass the full functionality of the oracle system we describe: both the data structure that oracle nodes maintain and the core API layered on top of it. We use the term ledger (lower case), denoted by L, to mean the underlying data structure maintained by a DON and used to support the particular services it provides. We emphasize that our DON framework does not treat L as a freestanding system like a blockchain: Its purpose is to support blockchains and other systems. Blockchains are, of course, one way of realizing a trustworthy ledger, but there are others. We expect DONs in many cases to realize their underlying ledgers using Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) systems, which considerably predate blockchains such as Bitcoin [174]. We use BFT-type notation and properties throughout the paper'},\n",

We expect DONs in many cases to realize their underlying ledgers using Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) systems, which considerably predate blockchains such as Bitcoin [174]. We use BFT-type notation and properties throughout the paper for convenience, although we emphasize that DONs can be realized using permissionless consensus protocols. Conceptually, a ledger L is a bulletin board on which data is linearly ordered. We view a ledger generally as having a few key properties commonly ascribed to blockchains [115]. A ledger is: • Append-only: Data, once added, cannot be removed or modified. • Public: Anyone can read its contents, which are consistent across time in the view of all users.4 • Available: The ledger can always be written to by authorized writers and read by anyone in a timely way. Alternative properties are possible in the ledger for a DON when realized by a committee. For instance, ledger write access might be restricted to certain users, as might read access for some applications, i.e., the ledger need not be public as defined above. Similarly, ledger rules might permit modification or redaction of data. We don’t explicitly consider such variants in this paper, however. The modular design of DONs can support any of a wide variety of modern BFT protocols, e.g., Hotstuff[231]. The exact choice will depend on trust assumptions and network characteristics among the oracle nodes. A DON could in principle alternatively use a highly performant permissionless blockchain for its ledger in its role supporting an equally scalable layer-2 or blockchain system. Similarly, hybridization is also possible: The DON could in principle be composed of nodes that are validators in an existing blockchain, e.g., in Proof-of-Stake systems in which committees are selected to execute transactions, e.g., [8, 81, 120, 146, 204]. This particular mode of operation requires that nodes operate in a dual-use manner, i.e., operate both as blockchain nodes and DON nodes. (See Section 8.2 for a discussion of techniques to ensure continuity in changing committees and Appendix F for some caveats on random committee selection.) In practice, in modern BFT algorithms, nodes digitally sign messages on the ledger. We assume for convenience that L has an associated public key pkL and that its contents are signed by the corresponding private key. This general notation applies even when data on L are signed using threshold signatures.5 Threshold signatures are convenient, as they enable a persistent identity for a DON even with changes of membership in the nodes running it. (See Appendix B.1.3.) We thus assume that skL is secret-shared in a (k, n)-threshold manner for some security parameter k, e.g., k = 2f + 1 and n = 3f + 1, where f is the number of potentially faulty nodes. (By choosing k in this way, we ensure that faulty nodes can neither learn skL nor mount a denial-of-service attack preventing its use.) A message on L takes the form M = (m, z), where m is a string and z a unique sequential index number. Where applicable, we write messages in the form m = ⟨MessageType : payload⟩. The message type MessageType is syntactic sugar that in- dicates the function of a particular message. 4In cases where a blockchain without finality realizes a'},\n",

The message type MessageType is syntactic sugar that in- dicates the function of a particular message. 4In cases where a blockchain without finality realizes a ledger, inconsistency is typically abstracted away by disregarding insufficiently deep blocks or “pruning” [115]. 5In practice, some code bases, e.g., LibraBFT [205], a variant of Hotstuff, have currently adopted multi-signatures, rather than threshold signatures, trading offreduced communication complexity for simpler engineering. With some added cost, oracle nodes can append threshold signatures to messages written to L even if the consensus protocol used for L doesn’t employ them. 2.3 Notation We denote the set of n oracle nodes running the ledger by O = {Oi}n i=1. Such a set of nodes is often called a committee. For simplicity, we assume that the set of oracles implementing DON functionality, i.e., services on top of L, is identical with that maintaining L, but they can be distinct. We let pki denote the public key of player Oi, and ski the corresponding private key. Most BFT algorithms require at least n = 3f + 1 nodes, where f is the number of potentially faulty nodes; remaining nodes are honest, in the sense that they follow the protocol exactly as specified. We refer to the committee O as honest if it meets this requirement, i.e., has greater than a 2/3-fraction of honest nodes. Unless otherwise stated, we assume that O is honest (and a static model of corruption). We use pkO / skO interchangeably with pkL / skL, depending on the context. We let σ = Sigpk[m] denote a signature on message m with respect to pk, i.e., using corresponding private key sk. Let verify(pk, σ, m) →{false, true} denote a corre- sponding signature verification algorithm. (We leave key generation implicit through- out the paper.) We use the notation S to denote a data source and S to denote the full set of nS sources in a given context. We denote by MAINCHAIN a smart-contract enabled blockchain supported by a DON. We use the term relying contract to denote any smart contract on MAINCHAIN that communicates with a DON, and use the notation SC to denote such a contract. We generally assume that a DON supports a single main chain MAINCHAIN, al- though it can support multiple such chains, as we show in examples in Section 4. A DON can and typically will support multiple relying contracts on MAINCHAIN. (As noted above, a DON can alternatively support non-blockchain services.) 2.4 Note on Trust Models As noted above, DONs may be built atop committee-based consensus protocols, and we expect they will commonly use such protocols. There are many strong arguments that one of the two alternatives, committee-based or permissionless blockchains, provides stronger security than the other. It is important to recognize that the security of committee-based vs. permissionless decentralized systems is incommensurable. Compromising a PoW or a PoS blockchain via 51% attack requires that an adversary obtain majority resources ephemerally and potentially anonymously, for example by renting hash power in a PoW system. Such attacks in practice have already impacted several blockchains [200, 34]. In contrast, compromising a committee-based system means corrupting a threshold number (typi-'},\n",

In contrast, compromising a committee-based system means corrupting a threshold number (typi- cally one-third) of its nodes, where the nodes may be publicly known, well resourced, and trustworthy entities. On the other hand, committee-based systems (as well as “hybrid” permissionless systems that support committees) can support more functionality than strictly per- missionless systems. This includes the ability to maintain persistent secrets, such as signing and/or encryption keys-one possibility in our designs. We emphasize that DONs can in principle be built atop either a committee-based or permissionless consensus protocol and DON deployers may ultimately choose to adopt either approach. Bolstering trust models: A key feature of Chainlink today is the ability of users to select nodes based on decentralized records of their performance histories, as discussed in Section 3.6.4. The staking mechanism and Implicit-Incentive Framework we intro- duce in Section 9 together constitute a broadly scoped and rigorous mechanism-design framework that will empower users with a greatly expanded ability to gauge the secu- rity of DONs. This same framework will also make it possible for DONs themselves to enforce various security requirements on participating nodes and ensure operation within strong trust models. It is also possible using tools described in this paper for DONs to enforce spe- cial trust-model requirements, such as compliance with regulatory requirements. For example, using techniques discussed in Section 4.3, nodes can present evidence of node-operator characteristics, e.g., territory of operation, that can be used to help enforce compliance with, e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Ar- ticle 3 (“Territorial Scope”) [105]. Such compliance can otherwise be challenging to meet in decentralized systems [45]. Additionally, in Section 7 we discuss plans to strengthen the robustness of DONs through trust-minimization mechanisms on the main chains they support. Decentralized Oracle Network Interface and Ca- pabilities Here we briefly sketch the capabilities of DONs in terms of the simple but powerful interface they are designed to realize. Applications on a DON are composed of executables and adapters. An executable is a program whose core logic is a deterministic program, analogous to a smart contract. An executable also has a number of accompanying initiators, programs that call entry points in the executable’s logic when predetermined events occur-e.g., at certain times (like a cron job), when a price crosses a threshold, etc.-much like Keepers (see Sec- tion 3.6.3). Adapters provide interfaces to off-chain resources and may be called by either the initiators or core logic in executables. As their behavior may depend on that of external resources, initiators and adapters may behave non-deterministically. We describe the DON developer interface and the functioning of executables and adapters in terms of the three resources typically used to characterize computing sys- tems: networking, compute, and storage. We give a brief overview of each of these resources below and provide more details in Appendix B. 3.1 Networking Adapters are interfaces through which executables running on a DON can send and receive data from off-DON systems.

Adapters may be viewed as a generalization of the adapters used in Chainlink today [20]. Adapters may be bidirectional-i.e., they cannot just pull, but push data from a DON to a web server. They may also leverage distributed protocols as well as cryptographic functionality such as secure multi-party computation. Figure 9: Adapters connecting a DON, denoted DON1, with a range of different re- sources, including another DON, denoted DON2, a blockchain (main chain) and its mempool, external storage, a web server, and IoT devices (via a web server). Examples of external resources for which adapters might be created are shown in Fig. 9. They include: • Blockchains: An adapter can define how to send transactions to a blockchain and how to read blocks, individual transactions, or other state from it. An adapter can also be defined for a blockchain’s mempool. (See Section 3.5.) • Web servers: Adapters can define APIs through which data may be retrieved from web servers, including legacy systems that are not specially adapted for interfacing with DONs. Such adapters can also include APIs to send data to such servers. The web servers to which a DON connects may serve as gateways to additional resources, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. • External storage: An adapter can define methods to read and write to storage services outside the DON, such as a decentralized file system [40, 188] or cloud storage. • Other DONs: Adapters can retrieve and transmit data between DONs. We expect that initial deployments of DONs will include a set of building block adapters for such commonly used external resources and will further allow DON-specific adapters to be published by DON nodes. As smart contract developers write adapters today, we expect that they will build even more powerful adapters using this advanced functionality. We expect that ultimately it will be possible for users to create new adapters in a permissionless manner. Some adapters must be constructed in a way that ensures the persistence and avail- ability of external resources controlled by a DON. For example, cloud storage may require maintenance of a cloud services account. Additionally, a DON can perform decentralized management of private keys on behalf of users (as in, e.g., [160]) and/or executables. Consequently, the DON is capable of controlling resources, such as cryp- tocurrency, that may be used, e.g., for sending transactions on a target blockchain. See Appendix B.1 for further details on DON adapters, as Appendix C for a few example adapters. 3.2 Computation An executable is the basic unit of code on a DON. An executable is a pair exec = (logic, init). Here, logic is a deterministic program with a number of designated entry points (logic1, logic2, . . . , logicℓ) and init is a set of corresponding initiators (init1, init2, . . . , inite). To ensure the full auditability of the DON, an executable’s logic uses the underlying ledger L for all inputs and outputs. Thus, for instance, any adapter data serving as input to an executable must be stored first on L.

Thus, for instance, any adapter data serving as input to an executable must be stored first on L. Initiators: Initiators in Chainlink today cause event-dependent job executions on Chainlink nodes [21]. Initiators in DONs function in much the same way. A DON ini- tiator, however, is specifically associated with an executable. An initiator may depend on an external event or state, on the current time, or on a predicate on DON state. With their dependency on events, initiators may of course behave non-deterministically (as of course may adapters). An initiator can execute within individual DON nodes and so need not rely on an adapter. (See Example 1 below.) Initiators are an important feature distinguishing executables from smart contracts. Because an executable can run in response to an initiator, it can effectively operate autonomously, as of course by extension can a hybrid contract incorporating the exe- cutable. One form of initiators today are Chainlink Keepers, which provide transaction automation services, triggering smart contract execution-such as liquidation of un- dercollateralized loans and execution of limit-order trades-based on oracle reports. Conveniently, initiators in DONs may also be viewed as a way of specifying the service agreements that apply to an executable, as they define the circumstances under which the DON must call it. The following example illustrates how initiators work within an executable: Example 1 (Deviation-triggered price feed). A smart contract SC may require fresh price-feed data (see Section 3.6.3) whenever there is a substantial change, e.g., 1%, in the exchange rate between a pair of assets, e.g., ETH-USD. Volatility-sensitive price feeds are supported in Chainlink today, but it is instructive to see how they can be realized on a DON by means of an executable execfeed. The executable execfeed maintains the most recent ETH-USD price r on L, in the form of a sequence of ⟨NewPrice : j, r⟩entries, where j is an index incremented with each price update. An initiator init1 causes each node Oi to monitor the current ETH-USD price for deviations of at least 1% from the most recently stored price r with index j. Upon detection of such a deviation, Oi writes its current view ri of the new price to L using an entry of the form ⟨PriceView : i, j + 1, ri⟩. A second initiator init2 fires when at least k such PriceView-entries with new price values for index j + 1 created by distinct nodes have accumulated on L. Then, init2 invokes an entry point logic2 to compute the median ρ of the first k fresh, valid price- view values and writes a fresh value ⟨NewPrice : j + 1, ρ⟩to L . (Operationally, nodes may take turns as designated writers.) A third initiator init3 watches for NewPrice entries on L. Whenever a new report ⟨NewPrice : j, r⟩appears there, it invokes an entry point logic3 that pushes (j, r) to SC using an adapter. As we have noted, an executable is similar in its capabilities to a smart contract. Apart from its higher performance, though, it differs from a typical main chain contract in two essential ways: 1.

As we have noted, an executable is similar in its capabilities to a smart contract. Apart from its higher performance, though, it differs from a typical main chain contract in two essential ways: 1. Confidentiality: An executable can perform confidential computation, i.e., a se- cret program may process cleartext inputs, or a published program may process secret input data, or a combination of both. In a simple model, secret data can be accessed by DON nodes, which conceal intermediate results and disclose only processed and sanitized values to MAINCHAIN. It is also possible to conceal sen- sitive data from DONs themselves: DONs are meant to support approaches such as multi-party computation, e.g., [42, 157], and trusted execution environments (TEEs) [84, 133, 152, 229] for this purpose.6 6By extension, keeping executables themselves secret with respect to DON nodes is also possible, although this is only practical today for non-trivial executables using TEEs. 2. Supporting role: An executable is meant to support smart contracts on a main chain, rather than replace them. An executable has several limitations that a smart contract does not: (a) Trust model: An executable operates within the trust model defined by the DON: Its correct execution relies on the honest behavior of O. (A main chain can, however, provide some guard rails against DON malfeasance, as discussed in Section 7.3.) (b) Asset access: A DON can control an account on a blockchain-and thus control assets on it through an adapter. But a DON cannot authoritatively represent assets created on a main chain, e.g., Ether or ERC20 tokens, since their native chain maintains the authoritative record of their ownership. (c) Lifecycle: DONs may be stood up intentionally with limited lifetimes, as defined by on-chain service level agreements between DONs and the owners of relying contracts. Blockchains, in contrast, are meant to function as permanent archival systems. See Appendix B.2 for further details on DON computation. 3.3 Storage As a committee-based system, a DON can store moderate amounts of data persistently on L at much lower cost than a permissionless blockchain. Additionally, via adapters, DONs can reference external decentralized systems for data storage, e.g., Filecoin [85], and can thereby connect such systems to smart contracts. This option is particularly attractive for bulk data as a means of addressing the pervasive problem of “bloat” in blockchain systems. DONs can thus store data locally or externally for use in their specifically sup- ported services. A DON can additionally make use of such data in a confidential way, computing on data that is: (1) secret-shared across DON nodes or encrypted under a key managed by DON nodes in ways suitable for secure multi-party computation or partial or fully homomorphic encryption; or (2) protected using a trusted execution environment. We expect that DONs will adopt a simple memory-management model common to smart-contract systems: An executable may only write to its own memory. Executables may, however, read from the memory of other executables. See Appendix B.3 for further details on DON storage. 3.4 Transaction-Execution Framework (TEF) DONs are intended to support contracts on a main chain MAINCHAIN (or on multi- ple main chains). The Transaction-Execution Framework (TEF), discussed in detail in Section 6, is a general-purpose approach to the efficient execution of a contract SC across MAINCHAIN and a DON. The TEF is intended to support FSS and'},\n",

The Transaction-Execution Framework (TEF), discussed in detail in Section 6, is a general-purpose approach to the efficient execution of a contract SC across MAINCHAIN and a DON. The TEF is intended to support FSS and layer-2 technologies-simultaneously, if desired. Indeed, it is likely to serve as the main vehicle for use of FSS (and for that reason, we do not further discuss FSS in this section). Briefly, in TEF an original target contract SC designed or developed for MAINCHAIN is refactored into a hybrid contract. This refactoring produces the two interoperating pieces of the hybrid contract: a MAINCHAIN contract SCa that we refer to for clarity in the context of TEFs as an anchor contract and an executable execs on a DON. The contract SCa custodies users’ assets, executes authoritative state transitions, and also provides guard rails (see Section 7.3) against failures in the DON. The executable execs sequences transactions and provides associated oracle data for them. It can bundle transactions for SCa in any of a number of ways-e.g., using validity-proof-based or optimistic rollups, confidential execution by the DON, etc. We expect to develop tools that make it easy for developers to partition a contract SC written in a high-level language into pieces of MAINCHAIN and DON logic, SCa and execs respectively, that compose securely and efficiently. Using TEF to integrate high-performance transaction schemes with high-performance oracles is integral to our oracle scaling approach. 3.5 Mempool Services An important application-layer feature that we intend to deploy on DONs in support of FSS and the TEF are Mempool Services (MS). MS may be viewed as an adapter, but one with first-class support. MS provides support for legacy-compatible transaction processing. In this use, MS ingests from a main chain’s mempool those transactions intended for a target contract SC on MAINCHAIN. MS then passes these transactions to an executable on the DON, where they are processed in the desired way. MS data can be used by the DON to compose transactions that can then be passed directly to SC from the DON or to another contract that calls SC. For example, the DON can forward transactions harvested via MS, or it can use MS data to set gas prices for transactions it sends to MAINCHAIN. Because it monitors the mempool, MS can obtain transactions from users inter- acting directly with SC. Thus users may continue to generate their transactions using legacy software, i.e., applications unaware of the existence of MS and MS-configured contracts. (In this case, SC must be changed to ignore the original transactions and accept only those processed by the MS, so as to avoid double-processing.) For use with a target contract SC, MS can be used with FSS and/or the TEF. 3.6 Stepping Stones: Existing Chainlink Capabilities 3.6.1 Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) [60] is a mechanism in Chainlink for oracle report aggrega- tion and transmission to a relying contract SC. Recently deployed for Chainlink price feed networks, it represents a first step along the path to full DONs. At its core, OCR is a BFT protocol designed to operate in a partially synchronous network.

Recently deployed for Chainlink price feed networks, it represents a first step along the path to full DONs. At its core, OCR is a BFT protocol designed to operate in a partially synchronous network. It ensures liveness and correctness in the presence of f < n/3 arbitrarily faulty nodes, guaranteeing the properties of Byzantine reliable broadcast, but it is not a complete BFT consensus protocol. Nodes do not maintain message logs that are consistent in the sense of representing a ledger that is identical in all of their views, and the leader of the protocol may equivocate without violating safety. OCR is currently designed for a particular message type: medianized aggregation of (at least 2f +1) values reported by participating nodes. It provides a key assurance on the reports it outputs for SC, called attested reports: The median value in an attested report is equal to or lies between values reported by two honest nodes. This property is the key safety condition for OCR. The leader may have some influence on the median value in an attested report, but only subject to this correctness condition. OCR can be extended to message types that aggregate values in different ways. While the Chainlink network’s liveness and correctness goals today do not require OCR to be a full-blown consensus protocol, they do require OCR to provide some addi- tional forms of functionality not present in conventional BFT protocols, most notably: 1. All-or-nothing off-chain report broadcast: OCR ensures that an attested report is made quickly available to all honest nodes or none of them. This is a fairness property that helps ensure that honest nodes have an opportunity to participate in attested report transmission. 2. Reliable transmission: OCR ensures, even in the presence of faulty or malicious nodes, that all OCR reports and messages are transmitted to SC within a certain, pre-defined interval of time. This is a liveness property. 3. Contract-based trust minimization: SC filters out potentially erroneous OCR- generated reports, e.g., if their reported values deviate significantly from other recently received ones. This is a form of extra-protocol correctness enforcement. All three of these properties will play a natural role in DONs. All-or-nothing off- chain (DON) broadcast is an important building block for cryptoeconomic assurances around reliable transmission, which is in turn an essential adapter property. Trust minimization in SC is a type of guard rail, as discussed in Section 7.3. OCR also provides a basis for operational deployment and refinement of BFT pro- tocols in Chainlink’s oracle networks and thus, as noted above, a path to the full functionality of DONs. 3.6.2 DECO and Town Crier DECO [234] and Town Crier [233] are a pair of related technologies currently being developed in Chainlink networks. Most web servers today allow users to connect over a secure channel using a protocol called Transport Layer Security (TLS) [94]. (HTTPS indicates a variant of HTTP that is enabled with TLS, i.e., URLs prefixed with “https” denote use of TLS for security.) Most TLS-enabled servers have a notable limitation, though: They don’t digitally sign data. Consequently, a user or Prover cannot present the data she receives from a server to a third party or Verifier, such as an oracle or smart contract, in a way that ensures the data’s authenticity.

Consequently, a user or Prover cannot present the data she receives from a server to a third party or Verifier, such as an oracle or smart contract, in a way that ensures the data’s authenticity. Even if a server were to digitally sign data, there remains a problem of confiden- tiality. A Prover may wish to redact or modify sensitive data before presenting it to a Verifier. Digital signatures are designed specifically to invalidate modified data, how- ever. They thus prevent a Prover from making confidentiality-preserving alterations to data. (See Section 7.1 for more discussion.) DECO and Town Crier are designed to allow a Prover to obtain data from a web server and present it to a Verifier in a way that ensures integrity and confidentiality. The two systems preserve integrity in the sense that they ensure that data presented by the Prover to the Verifier originates authentically from the target server. They support confidentiality in the sense of allowing the Prover to redact or modify data (while still preserving integrity). A key feature of both systems is that they do not require any modifications to a target web server. They can operate with any existing TLS-enabled server. In fact, they are transparent to the server: From the viewpoint of the server, the Prover is establishing an ordinary connection. The two systems have similar goals, but differ in their trust models and implemen- tations as we now briefly explain. DECO makes fundamental use of cryptographic protocols to achieve its integrity and confidentiality properties. While establishing a session with a target server us- ing DECO, the Prover engages at the same time in an interactive protocol with the Verifier. This protocol enables the Prover to prove to the Verifier that it has received a given piece of data D from the server during its current session. The Prover can alternatively present the Verifier with a zero-knowledge proof of some property of D and thus not reveal D directly. In a typical use of DECO, a user or a single node can export data D from a private session with a web server to all of the nodes in a DON. As a result, the full DON can attest to the authenticity of D (or a fact derived from D via a zero-knowledge proof). In addition to the example applications given later in the paper, this capability can be used to amplify high-integrity access to a data source by a DON. Even if only one node has direct access to a data source-due, for instance, to an exclusive arrangement with a data provider-it remains possible for the entire DON to attest to the correctness of reports emitted by that node. Town Crier relies on the use of a trusted execution environment (TEE) such as Intel SGX. Briefly, a TEE functions as a kind of black box that executes applications in a tamperproof and confidential way. In principle, even the owner of the host on which the TEE is running can neither (undetectably) alter a TEE-protected application nor view the application’s state, which may include secret data.

In contrast, Town Crier enables a Prover to generate a publicly verifiable proof on data D fetched from a target server, i.e., a proof that anyone, even a smart contract, can verify directly. Town Crier can also securely ingest and make use of secrets (e.g., user credentials). The main limitation of Town Crier is its reliance on TEEs. Production TEEs have recently been shown to have a number of serious vulnerabilities, although the technol- ogy is in its infancy and will undoubtedly mature. See Appendices B.2.1 and B.2.2 for further discussion of TEEs. For a few example applications of DECO and Town Crier, see Sections 4.3, 4.5 and 9.4.3 and Appendix C.1. 3.6.3 Existing On-Chain Chainlink Services Chainlink oracle networks provide a number of main services across a multiplicity of blockchains and other decentralized systems today. Further evolution as described in this whitepaper will endow these existing services with additional capabilities and reach. Three examples are: Data feeds: Today, the majority of Chainlink users relying on smart contracts make use of data feeds. These are reports on the current value of key pieces of data according to authoritative off-chain sources. For example, price feeds are feeds reporting the prices of assets-cryptocurrencies, commodities, forex, indexes, equities, etc.-according to exchanges or data-aggregation services. Such feeds today already help secure billions of dollars in on-chain value through their use in DeFi systems such as Aave [147] and Synthetix [208]. Other examples of Chainlink data feeds include weather data for parametric crop insurance [75] and election data [93], among a number of others. The deployment of DONs and other technologies described in this paper will en- hance provision of data feeds in Chainlink networks in many ways, including: • Scaling: OCR and subsequently DONs aim to enable Chainlink services to scale dramatically across the many blockchains they support. For example, we expect that DONs will help increase the number of data feeds provided by nodes using Chainlink from 100s to 1000s and beyond. Such scaling will help the Chainlink ecosystem achieve its goal of furnishing data relevant to smart contracts compre- hensively and both meeting and anticipating existing and future needs. • Enhanced security: By storing intermediate reports, DONs will retain records of node behaviors for high-fidelity monitoring and measurement of their perfor- mance and accuracy, enabling strong empirical grounding of reputation systems for Chainlink nodes. FSS and the TEF will enable price feeds to be incorporated with transaction data in flexible ways that prevent attacks such as front-running. (Explicit) staking will bolster existing cryptoeconomic protection of the security of data feeds. • Feed agility: As blockchain-agnostic systems (indeed, more broadly, consumer- agnostic systems), DONs can facilitate the provision of data feeds to a multiplicity of relying systems. A single DON can push a given feed simultaneously to a set of different blockchains, eliminating the need for per-chain oracle networks and enabling rapid deployment of existing feeds on new blockchains and of additional feeds across currently serviced blockchains. • Confidentiality: The ability to perform generalized computation in a DON en-'},\n",

Additionally, using DECO or Town Crier, it is possible to achieve even stronger confidentiality, allowing report generation based on data that isn’t exposed even to DON nodes. See Section 4.3 and Section 4.5 for examples. Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs): Several types of DApps require a verifi- ably correct source of randomness to enable verification of their own fair operation. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are an example. The rarity of NFT features in Aaveg- otchi [23] and Axie Infinity [35] is determined by Chainlink VRF, as is the distribution of NFTs by means of ticket-based drawings in Ether Cards [102]; the wide variety of gaming DApps whose outcomes are randomized; and unconventional financial instru- ments, e.g., no-loss savings games such as PoolTogether [89], which allocate funds to random winners. Other blockchain and non-blockchain applications also require secure sources of randomness, including selection of decentralized-system committees and the execution of lotteries. While block hashes can serve as a source of unpredictable randomness, they are vul- nerable to manipulation by adversarial miners (and to some extent by users submitting transactions). Chainlink VRF [78] offers a considerably more secure alternative. An oracle has an associated private / public key pair (sk, pk) whose private key is main- tained offchain and whose public key pk is published. To output a random value, it applies sk to an unpredictable seed x furnished by a relying contract (e.g., a block hash and DApp-specific parameters) using a function F, yielding y = Fsk(x) along with a proof of correctness. (See [180] for the VRF available on Chainlink.) What makes a VRF verifiable is the fact that with knowledge of pk, it is possible to check the correct- ness of the proof and therefore of y. The value y is consequently unpredictable to an adversary that cannot predict x or learn sk and infeasible for the service to manipulate. Chainlink VRF may be viewed as just one of a family of applications that in- volve custodianship of private keys offchain. More generally, DONs can offer secure, decentralized storage of individual keys for applications and/or users, and combine this capability with generalized computation. The result is a host of applications, of which we give some examples in this paper, including key management for Proof of Reserves (see Section 4.1) and for users’ decentralized credentials (and other digital assets) (see Section 4.3). Keepers: Chainlink Keepers [87] enable developers to write code for decentralized execution of off-chain jobs, generally to trigger execution of relying smart contracts. Before the advent of Keepers, it was common for developers to operate such off-chain logic themselves, creating centralized points of failure (as well as considerable du- plicated development effort). Keepers instead provide an easy-to-use framework for decentralized outsourcing of these operations, enabling shorter development cycles and strong assurance of liveness and other security properties. Keepers can support any of a wide variety of triggering goals, including price-dependent liquidation of loans or execution of financial transactions,'},\n",

In the DON framework, initiators may be viewed as a generalization of Keep- ers in several senses. Initiators may make use of adapters, and thus can leverage a modularized library of interfaces to on-chain and off-chain systems, permitting rapid development of secure, sophisticated functionality. Initiators initiate computation in executables, which themselves offer the full versatility of DONs, permitting the wide range of decentralized services we present in this paper for on-chain and off-chain ap- plications. 3.6.4 Node Reputation / Performance History The existing Chainlink ecosystem natively documents the performance histories of contributing nodes on chain. This feature has given rise to a collection of reputation- oriented resources that ingest, filter, and visualize performance data on individual node operators and data feeds. Users can reference these resources to make informed decisions in their selection of nodes and to monitor the operation of existing networks. Similar capabilities will help users choose DONs. For example, permissionless marketplaces today such as market.link allow node operators to list their oracle services and attest to their off-chain identities through services such as Keybase [4], which bind the profile of a node in Chainlink to its owner’s existing domain names and social media accounts. Additionally, performance analytics tools, such as those available at market.link and reputation.link, allow users to view statistics on the historical performance of individual nodes, including their average response latency, the deviation of values in their reports from consensus values relayed on chain, revenue generated, jobs fulfilled, and more. These analytics tools also allow users to track the adoption of various oracle networks by other users, a form of implicit endorsement of the nodes securing such networks. The result is a flat “web of trust” in which, by using particular nodes, high-value decentralized applications create a signal of their trust in those nodes that other users can observe and factor into their own node-selection decisions. With DONs (and initially with OCR) comes a shift in transaction processing and contract activity more generally offchain. A decentralized model for recording node performance remains possible within the DON itself. Indeed, the high performance and data capacity of DONs make it possible to construct records in a fine-grained way and also to perform decentralized computation on these records, yielding trust- worthy summaries that can be consumed by reputation services and checkpointed on MAINCHAIN. While it is possible for a DON in principle to misrepresent the behavior of con- stituent nodes if a large fraction of nodes is corrupted, we note that the collective performance of a DON itself in delivering on-chain data is visible on MAINCHAIN and thus cannot be misrepresented. Additionally, we plan to explore mechanisms that incentivize accurate internal reporting of node behaviors in a DON. For example, by re- porting the subset of high-performing nodes that most quickly return data contributing to a report relayed on chain, a DON creates an incentive for nodes to contest incorrect reports: Incorrectly including nodes'},\n",

For example, by re- porting the subset of high-performing nodes that most quickly return data contributing to a report relayed on chain, a DON creates an incentive for nodes to contest incorrect reports: Incorrectly including nodes in this subset means incorrectly excluding nodes that should have been included and therefore invalidly penalizing them. Repeated re- porting failures by a DON would also create an incentive for honest nodes to leave the DON. Decentralized compilation of accurate performance histories and the consequent ability of users to identify high-performing nodes and for node operators to build reputations are important distinguishing features of the Chainlink ecosystem. We show in Section 9 how we can reason about them as a key piece of a rigorous and expansive view of the economic security provided by DONs. Decentralized Services Enabled by Decentralized Oracle Networks To illustrate the versatility of DONs and how they enable a host of new services, we present five examples of DON-based applications in this section and describe the hybrid contracts that realize them: (1) Proof of Reserves, a form of cross-chain service; (2) Interfacing with enterprise / legacy systems, that is, creating a middleware-based abstraction layer that facilitates development of blockchain applications with minimal blockchain-specific code or expertise; (3) Decentralized identity, tools enabling users to obtain and manage their own identity documents and credentials; (4) Priority channels, a service that ensures timely inclusion of critical-infrastructure transactions (e.g., oracle reports) on a blockchain; and (5) Confidentiality-preserving DeFi, that is, financial smart contracts that conceal the sensitive data of participating parties. Here, we use SC to denote the MAINCHAIN part of a hybrid contract and describe the DON component separately or in terms of an executable exec. 4.1 Proof of Reserves For many applications, it is useful to relay state between or among blockchains. A popular application of such services is cryptocurrency wrapping. Wrapped coins such as WBTC [15] are becoming a popular asset in Decentralized Finance (DeFi). They involve depositing the “wrapped” backing asset on its source blockchain MAINCHAIN(1) and creating a corresponding token on a different, target blockchain MAINCHAIN(2). For example, WBTC is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain that corresponds to BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain. Because contracts on MAINCHAIN(2) do not have direct visibility into MAINCHAIN(1), they must rely explicitly or implicitly on an oracle to report on deposits of the wrapped asset in a smart contract, producing what is sometimes called a Proof of Reserves. In WBTC [15], for example, custodian BitGo holds BTC and issues WBTC, with the Chainlink network providing Proofs of Reserve [76]. A DON can itself provide a Proof of Reserves. With a DON, however, it is possible to go further. A DON can manage secrets and, through use of appropriate adapters, can transact on any desired blockchain. Consequently, it is possible for the DON to act as one among a number of custodians-or even as a sole, decentralized custodian-for a wrapped asset. DONs can thereby serve as a platform to enhance the security of existing services that use Proofs of Reserves. For example, suppose that MAINCHAIN(1) is Bitcoin and MAINCHAIN(2) is Ethereum. On MAINCHAIN(2), a contract SC issues tokens representing wrapped BTC. The DON controls a BTC address addr(1)'},\n",

On MAINCHAIN(2), a contract SC issues tokens representing wrapped BTC. The DON controls a BTC address addr(1) DON. To wrap BTC, then, a user U sends X BTC from addr(1) U to addr(1) DON along with a MAINCHAIN(2)-address addr(2) U . The DON monitors addr(1) DON via an adapter to MAINCHAIN(1). On observing U’s deposit, with suffi- ciently high-probability confirmation, it sends a message to SC via an adapter to MAINCHAIN(2). This message instructs SC to mint X tokens for addr(2) U . For U to release X tokens, the reverse happens. On MAINCHAIN(1), however, addr(1) DON sends X BTC to addr(1) U (or to another address, if thus requested by the user). These protocols can be adapted, of course, to work with exchanges, rather than directly with users. 4.2 Interfacing with Enterprise / Legacy Systems DONs can serve as bridges between and among blockchains, as in the example of Proof of Reserves, but another objective is for them to act as bidirectional bridges between blockchains and legacy systems [176] or blockchain-like systems such as central bank digital currencies [30]. Enterprises face a number of challenges in connecting their existing systems and processes to decentralized systems, including: • Blockchain agility: Blockchain systems change rapidly. An enterprise may con- front the rapid new appearance or rise in popularity of blockchains on which counterparties wish to conduct transactions, but for which the enterprise has no support in its existing infrastructure. In general, blockchains’ dynamism makes it difficult for individual enterprises to remain abreast of the full ecosystem. • Blockchain-specific development resources: For many organizations, hiring or in- cubating cutting-edge blockchain expertise is difficult, particularly in view of the challenge of agility. • Private-key management: Managing private keys for blockchains or cryptocurren- cies requires operational expertise distinct from that of traditional cybersecurity practices and unavailable to many enterprises. • Confidentiality: Enterprises are leery of exposing their sensitive and proprietary data on chain. To address the first three of these difficulties, developers can simply use a DON as a secure middleware layer to enable enterprise systems to read from or write to blockchains. The DON can abstract away detailed technical considerations such as gas dynamics, chain reorganization, and so forth, for both developers and users. By presenting a streamlined blockchain interface to enterprise systems, a DON can thus considerably simplify the development of blockchain-aware enterprise applications, re- moving the burden from enterprises of acquiring or incubating blockchain-specific de- velopment resources. Such use of DONs is especially attractive in that it enables enterprise developers to create smart-contract applications that are largely blockchain agnostic. As a result, the larger the set of blockchains for which a DON is instrumented to act as middleware, the larger the set of blockchains to which enterprise users can gain easy access. Developers can port applications from existing blockchains to new ones with minimal modification to their internally developed applications. To address the additional problem of confidentiality, developers can appeal to the tools we introduce in this paper and expect to deploy in support of DON applications.

These DON systems can provide high-integrity, on-chain attestations about enterprise system state without revealing sensitive enterprise source data on chain. 4.3 Decentralized Identity Decentralized identity is a general term for the notion that users should be able to obtain and manage their own credentials, rather than relying on third parties to do so. Decentralized credentials are attestations to attributes or assertions of the holder, which are often called claims. Credentials are digitally signed by entities, often called issuers, that can authoritatively associate claims with users. In most proposed schemes, claims are associated with a Decentralized Identifier (DID), a universal identifier for a given user. Credentials are bound to a public key whose private key the user holds. The user can thus prove possession of a claim using her private key. Visionary as decentralized identity is, existing and proposed schemes, e.g., [14, 92, 129, 216], have three severe limitations: • Lack of legacy compatibility: Existing decentralized identity systems rely on a community of authorities, called issuers, to produce DID credentials. Because existing web services do not generally digitally sign data, issuers must be launched as special-purpose systems. Because there is no incentive to do this without a decentralized-identity ecosystem, a chicken-and-the-egg problem results. In other words, it’s unclear how to bootstrap an issuer ecosystem. • Unworkable key management: Decentralized identity systems require users to manage private keys, something that experience with cryptocurrency has shown to be an unworkable onus. It is estimated that some 4,000,000 Bitcoin have been lost forever because of key management failures [194], and many users store their crypto assets with exchanges [193], thereby undermining decentralization. • Lack of privacy-preserving Sybil resistance: A basic security requirement of ap- plications such as voting, fair allocation of tokens during token sales, etc. is that users be unable to assert multiple identities. Existing decentralized identity pro- posals require users to reveal their real-world identities in order to achieve such Sybil resistance, thereby undermining important privacy assurances. It is possible to address these problems using a combination of a committee of nodes performing distributed computation within a DON and the use of tools such as DECO or Town Crier, as shown in a system called CanDID [160]. DECO or Town Crier can by design turn existing web services without modification into confidentiality-preserving credential issuers. They enable a DON to export relevant data for this purpose into a credential while concealing sensitive data that should not appear in the credential. In addition, to facilitate key recovery for users, thus addressing the key-management problem, a DON can allow users to store private keys in secret-shared form. Users can recover their keys by proving to the nodes in the DON-similarly, using Town Crier or DECO-an ability to log into accounts with a set of predetermined web providers (e.g., Twitter, Google, Facebook).

The benefit of using Town Crier or DECO, as opposed to OAUTH, is user privacy. Those two tools enable a user to avoid revealing to the DON a web provider identifier-from which real-world identities can often be derived. Finally, to provide Sybil resistance, as shown in [160], it is possible for a DON to perform a privacy-preserving transformation of unique real-world identifiers for users (e.g., Social Security Numbers (SSNs)) into on-chain identifiers upon user registration. The system can thereby detect duplicate registrations without sensitive data such as SSNs being revealed to individual DON nodes.7 A DON can provide any of these services on behalf of external decentralized identity systems on permissionless or permissioned blockchains, e.g., instances of Hyperledger Indy [129]. Example application: KYC: Decentralized identity holds promise as a means to streamline requirements for financial applications on blockchains while improving user privacy. Two challenges it can help address are accreditation and compliance obliga- tions under anti-money-laundering / know-your-customer (AML / KYC) regulations. AML regulations in many countries require financial institutions (and other busi- nesses) to establish and verify the identities of individuals and businesses with which they perform transactions. KYC forms one component of a financial institution’s broader AML policy, which also typically involves monitoring user behaviors and watch- ing fund flows, among other things. KYC typically involves user presentation of identity credentials in some form (e.g., entry into an online web form, holding up an identity document in front of a user’s face in a video session, etc.). Secure creation of and presentation of decentralized credentials could in principle be a beneficial alternative in several respects, namely by: (1) Making the KYC process more efficient for users and financial institutions, because once a credential is obtained, it could be presented seamlessly to any financial institution; (2) Reducing fraud by reducing opportunities for identity theft through compromise of personally identifiable information (PII) and spoofing during video verification; and (3) Reducing the risk of PII compromise in financial institutions, as users retain control of their own data. Given the multi-billion-dollar penalties paid by financial institutions for AML com- pliance failures, and the many financial institutions spending millions of dollars annu- ally on KYC, improvements could yield considerable savings for financial institutions and, by extension, for consumers [196]. While the traditional financial sector is slow to adopt new compliance tools, DeFi systems are increasingly embracing it [43]. Example application: Under-collateralized loans: Most DeFi applications that support lending today originate only fully collateralized loans. These are loans made to borrowers who deposit cryptocurrency assets of value exceeding that of the loans. Interest has arisen recently in what the DeFi community generally refers to as under- collateralized loans. These, by contrast, are loans for which the corresponding collateral has value that is less than that of the principal of the loan. Under-collateralized loans resemble loans often made by traditional financial institutions. Rather than relying on deposited collateral as a guarantee of loan repayment, they instead base lending decisions on the credit histories of borrowers. 7This transformation relies on a distributed pseudorandom function (PRF).

Under-collateralized loans constitute a nascent but growing part of the DeFi lend- ing market. They rely upon mechanisms like those employed by traditional financial institutions, such as legal contracts [91]. An essential requirement for their growth will be the ability to furnish data on user creditworthiness-a key factor in conven- tional lending decisions-to DeFi systems in a way that provides strong integrity, i.e., assurance of correct data. A DON-enabled decentralized identity system would enable would-be borrowers to generate high-assurance credentials attesting to their creditworthiness while preserving the confidentiality of sensitive information. Specifically, borrowers can generate these credentials based on records from authoritative online sources while exposing only the data attested to by the DON, without exposing other, potentially sensitive data. For example, a borrower can generate a credential indicating that her credit score with a set of credit bureaus exceeds a particular threshold (e.g., 750), without revealing her precise score or any other data in her records. Additionally, if desired, such credentials can be generated anonymously, i.e., the user’s name can be treated as sensitive data and itself not exposed to oracle nodes or in her decentralized credential. The credential itself can be used on chain or offchain, depending on the application. In summary, a borrower can provide essential information to lenders on their credit histories with strong integrity and without risk of exposure of unnecessary, sensitive data. A borrower can also provide a variety of other confidentiality-preserving credentials helpful in making lending decisions. For example, credentials can attest to a borrower’s possession of (off-chain) assets, as we show in our next example. Example application: Accreditation: Many jurisdictions limit the class of in- vestor to which unregistered securities may be sold. For example, in the U.S., SEC Regulation D stipulates that to be accredited for such investment opportunities, an individual must possess a net worth of $1 million, meet certain minimum income re- quirements, or have certain professional qualifications [209, 210]. Current accreditation processes are cumbersome and inefficient, often requiring a letter of attestation from an accountant, or similar evidence. A decentralized identity system would enable users to generate credentials from existing online financial services accounts that prove compliance with accreditation regulations, facilitating a more efficient and privacy-preserving KYC process. The privacy-preserving properties of DECO and Town Crier, moreover, would allow these credentials to be generated with a strong assurance of integrity without directly reveal- ing details of a user’s financial status. For example, a user could generate a credential proving that she has a net worth of at least $1 million without revealing any additional information about her financial status. 4.4 Priority Channels Priority channels are a useful new service that is easy to build using a DON. Their goal is to deliver select, high-priority transactions in a timely way on MAINCHAIN during periods of network congestion.

Priority channels may be viewed as a form of futures contract on block space and thus as a cryptocommodity, a term coined as part of Project Chicago [61, 136]. Priority channels are intended specifically for miners to enable infrastructure ser- vices, such as oracles, governance functions for contracts, etc.-not for ordinary user- level activities such as financial transactions. In fact, as designed here, a priority channel implemented by less than 100% of the mining power in the network can only provide loose bounds on delivery times, preventing its use for highly speed-dependent goals such as front-running. Figure 10: A priority channel is a guarantee by a miner M-or, more generally, a set of miners M-to a user U that her transaction τ will be mined within D blocks of inclusion in the mempool. A contract SC can use DON monitoring to enforce the service terms of the channel. A priority channel takes the form of an agreement between a miner or set of miners (or mining pools) M that provides the channel and a user U that pays a fee for access. M agrees that when U submits a transaction τ to the mempool (with any gas price, but a pre-agreed-upon gas limit), M will place it on chain within the next D blocks.8 The idea is depicted schematically in Fig. 10. Priority-channel contract description: A priority channel may be realized as a hybrid smart contract roughly as follows. We let SC denote the logic on MAINCHAIN and that on the DON by exec. SC accepts a deposit / stake $d from M and an advance payment $p from U. A DON executable exec monitors the mempool, triggering on placement of a transaction by U. It sends a success message to SC if U submits a transaction that M mines in a timely way and a failure message in case of a service failure. SC sends payment $p to M given a success message and sends all remaining funds, including $d, to U if it receives a failure message. Upon successful termination, it releases deposit $d to M. The miner M can of course provide priority channels simultaneously to multiple users and can open a priority channel with U for a pre-agreed-upon number of messages. 4.5 Confidentiality-Preserving DeFi / Mixicles Today, DeFi applications [1] provide little to no confidentiality for users: All transac- tions are visible on chain. Various zero-knowledge-based approaches, e.g., [149, 217], can provide transaction privacy, and the TEF is general enough to support them. But these approaches are not comprehensive, and do not, for example, typically conceal the asset on which a transaction is based. The broad set of computational tools we ultimately intend to support in DONs will enable privacy in a number of different ways that can plug such gaps, helping comple- ment the privacy assurances of other systems. For example, Mixicles, a confidentiality- preserving DeFi instrument proposed by Chainlink Labs researchers [135], can conceal the asset type backing a financial instrument, and fit very naturally into the DON framework. Mixicles are most easily explained in terms of their use to realize a simple binary option. A binary option is a financial instrument in which two users, which we’ll refer to'},\n",

For example, Mixicles, a confidentiality- preserving DeFi instrument proposed by Chainlink Labs researchers [135], can conceal the asset type backing a financial instrument, and fit very naturally into the DON framework. Mixicles are most easily explained in terms of their use to realize a simple binary option. A binary option is a financial instrument in which two users, which we’ll refer to here for consistency with [135] as players, bet on an event with two possible outcomes, e.g., whether or not an asset exceeds a target price at a predesignated time. The following example illustrates the idea. Example 2. Alice and Bob are parties to a binary option based on the value of an asset called Carol’s Bubble Token (CBT). Alice bets that CBT will have a market price of at least 250 USD at time T = noon on 21 June 2025; Bob bets the reverse. Each player deposits 100 ETH by a prespecified deadline. The player with the winning position receives 200 ETH (i.e., gains 100 ETH). 8D must of course be large enough to ensure that M can comply with high probability. For instance, if M controls 20% of the mining power in the network, it might choose D = 100, ensuring a failure probability of ≈2 × 10−10, i.e., less than one in a billion. Given an existing Chainlink oracle network O, it is easy to implement a smart contract SC that realizes the agreement in Example 2. The two players each deposit 100 ETH in SC. Sometime after T, a query q is sent to O requesting the price r of CBT at time T. O sends a report r of this price to SC. SC then sends money to Alice if r ≥250 and Bob if not. This approach, however, reveals r on chain-making it easy for an observer to deduce the asset underlying the binary option. In the terminology of Mixicles, it is helpful to think conceptually of the outcome of SC in terms of a Switch that transmits a binary value computed as a predicate switch(r). In our example, switch(r) = 0 if r ≥250; given this outcome, Alice wins. Otherwise switch(r) = 1 and Bob wins. A DON can realize a basic Mixicle as a hybrid contract by running an executable exec that computes switch(r) and reports it on chain to SC. We show this construction in Fig. 11. Figure 11: Diagram of basic Mixicle in Example 2. To provide on-chain secrecy for report r, and thus the asset underlying the binary option, the oracle sends to the contract SC via Switch only the binary value switch(r). We specify an adapter ConfSwitch in Appendix C.3 that makes it easy to achieve this goal in a DON. The basic idea behind ConfSwitch is quite simple. Instead of reporting the value r, ConfSwitch reports only the binary switch value switch(r). SC can be designed to make a correct payment based on switch(r) alone, and switch(r) by itself reveals no information about the underlying asset-CBT in our example. Additionally, by placing a ciphertext on (q, r) on the ledger encrypted under pkaud, the public key of an auditor, the adapter ConfSwitch creates a confidentiality-preserving audit trail. The basic Mixicle we’ve chosen for simplicity to describe here conceals only the asset and bet behind the binary option in our example. A full-blown Mixicle [135] can provide two'},\n",

A full-blown Mixicle [135] can provide two forms of confidentiality. It conceals from observers: (1) What event the players bet on (i.e., q and r) but also (2) Which player won the bet. Since Mixicles are executed on MAINCHAIN, either one player would need to relay switch(r) from the DON to MAINCHAIN, or an executable exec could be created that is triggered on output by ConfSwitch and calls another adapter to send switch(r) to MAINCHAIN. A third, subtle type of confidentiality is also worth considering. In a basic imple- mentation of ConfSwitch, O is running the adapter on the DON and thus learns the asset-CBT in our example-and thus the nature of the binary option. As discussed in Appendix C.3, however, it is additionally possible to use DECO or Town Crier to conceal even this information from O. In this case, the O learns no more information than a public observer of SC. For further details on Mixicles, we refer readers to [135]. Fair Sequencing Services One important service that we expect DONs will offer that leverages their network- ing, computation, and storage capabilities is called Fair Sequencing Services (FSS). Although FSS may be viewed simply as an application realized within the DON frame- work, we highlight it as a service that we believe will be in high demand across blockchains, and which we expect the Chainlink network to support actively. When executed on public blockchain networks, many of today’s DeFi applications reveal information that can be exploited by users to their own benefit, analogous to the kind of insider leaks and manipulation opportunities that are pervasive in existing markets [64, 155]. FSS instead paves the way toward a fair DeFi ecosystem. FSS helps developers to build DeFi contracts that are protected from market manipulation resulting from information leakage. Given the problems we highlight below, FSS is especially attractive for layer-2 services and fits within the framework for such services that we discuss in Section 6. The challenge: In existing permissionless systems, transactions are ordered entirely at the discretion of miners. In permissioned networks, the validator nodes may exert the same power. This is a form of largely unrecognized ephemeral centralization in otherwise decentralized systems. A miner can (temporarily) censor transactions for its own benefit [171] or reorder them to maximize its own gain, a notion called miner- extractable value (MEV) [90]. The term MEV is slightly deceptive: It does not refer only to value that miners can capture: Some MEV can be captured by ordinary users. Because miners have more power than ordinary users, however, MEV represents an up- per bound on the amount of value any entity can obtain through adversarial reordering and complementary transaction insertion. Even when miners order transactions simply based on fees (gas), without manipulation, users themselves can manipulate gas prices to advantage their transactions over those of less sophistication.

Daian et al. [90] document and quantify ways in which bots (not miners) take advantage of gas dynamics in a way that harms users of DeFi systems today and how MEV even threatens the stability of the underlying consensus layer in a blockchain. Other examples of transaction-order manipulation surface regularly, e.g., [50, 154]. New transaction-processing methods such as rollups are a very promising approach to the scaling problems of high-throughput blockchains. They do not, however, address the problem of MEV. Instead, they shift it to the entity that generates the rollup. That entity, whether the operator of a smart contract or a user furnishing a (zk-)rollup with a validity proof, has the power to order and insert transactions. In other words, rollups swap MEV for REV: Rollup-Extractable Value. MEV affects upcoming transactions that have been submitted to the mempool but are not yet committed on chain. Information about such transactions is broadly available in the network. Miners, validators, and ordinary network participants can therefore exploit this knowledge and create dependent transactions. In addition, min- ers and validators may influence the order of those transactions that they commit themselves and exploit this to their advantage. The problem of undue influence by leaders on transaction ordering in consensus protocols has been known in the literature since the 1990s [71, 190], but no satisfying solutions have been realized in practice so far [97]. The main reason is that pro- posed solutions-at least until very recently-cannot readily be integrated with public blockchains, as they rely on the content of transactions remaining secret until after their ordering has been determined. Fair Sequencing Services (FSS) overview: DONs will provide tools to decentral- ize transaction ordering and implement it according to a policy specified by a relying contract creator, ideally one that is fair, and not advantaging actors who wish to manipulate transaction ordering. Collectively, these tools constitute FSS. FSS includes three components. The first is monitoring of transactions. In FSS, oracle nodes in O both monitor the mempool of MAINCHAIN and (if desired) permit off-chain submission of transactions through a specialized channel. The second is se- quencing of transactions. The nodes in O order transactions for a relying contract according to a policy defined for that contract. The third is posting of transactions. After the transactions are ordered, the nodes in O jointly send the transactions to the main chain. The potential benefits of FSS include: • Order-fairness: FSS includes tools to help developers ensure that transactions input to a particular contract are ordered in a way that does not give an unfair advantage to well-resourced and/or technically savvy users. Ordering policies can be specified for this purpose. • Reduction or elimination of information leaks: By ensuring that network partic- ipants cannot exploit knowledge about upcoming transactions, FSS can abate or eliminate attacks like front-running that are based on information available in the network before transactions are committed. Preventing exploitation of such leakage ensures that adversarial transactions which depend on original pending transactions cannot enter the ledger before the original transactions are commit- ted. • Reduced transaction cost: By eliminating players’ need for speed in submitting their transactions to a smart contract, FSS can greatly reduce the cost'},\n",

For example, in order to prevent front-running attacks against oracle reports, e.g., [79], FSS can insert an oracle report into a stream of transactions retroactively. An overarching goal of the FSS in DONs is to empower DeFi creators to realize fair financial systems, that is, systems that don’t advantage particular users (or miners) over others on the basis of speed, insider knowledge, or ability to perform technical manipulation. While a crisp, general notion of fairness is elusive, and perfect fairness in any reasonable sense is unachievable, FSS aims to provide developers with a powerful set of tools so that they can enforce policies that help meet their design goals for DeFi. We note that while the main goal of FSS is to act as a fair sequencing service for the MAINCHAIN that DONs target, some of the same fairness desiderata that FSS guarantees can also be appropriate for (decentralized) protocols that are run among DON parties. Thus, FSS can be viewed more broadly as a service provided by a subset of DON nodes to fairly sequence not only transactions sent by users of MAINCHAIN but also transactions (i.e., messages) shared among other DON nodes. In this section, we will focus primarily on the goal of sequencing MAINCHAIN transactions. Section organization: In Section 5.1, we describe two high-level applications that mo- tivate the design of FSS: preventing front-running of oracle reports and preventing front-running of user transactions. We then provide more details on the design of FSS in Section 5.2. Section 5.3 describes examples of fair ordering guarantees and means to achieve them. Finally, Section 5.4 and Section 5.5 discuss network-level threats to such policies and means to address them, respectively for network flooding and Sybil attacks. 5.1 The Front-Running Problem To explain the goals and design of FSS, we describe two general forms of front-running attacks and the limitations of existing solutions. Front-running exemplifies a class of transaction-ordering attacks: There are a number of related attacks such as back- running and sandwiching (front-running plus back-running) [237] that we don’t cover here, but which FSS also helps address. 5.1.1 Oracle Front-Running In their traditional role of providing off-chain data to blockchain applications, oracles become a natural target for front-running attacks. Consider the common design pattern of using an oracle to supply various price feeds to an on-chain exchange: periodically (say every hour), the oracle collects price data for different assets and sends these to an exchange contract. These price-data transactions present obvious arbitrage opportunities: For example, if the newest oracle report lists a much higher price for some asset, an adversary could front-run the oracle report to buy up assets and immediately resell them once the oracle’s report is processed.

These price-data transactions present obvious arbitrage opportunities: For example, if the newest oracle report lists a much higher price for some asset, an adversary could front-run the oracle report to buy up assets and immediately resell them once the oracle’s report is processed. Speed bumps and retroactive pricing: A natural solution to the oracle front- running problem is to give oracle reports special priority over other transactions. For example, oracle reports could be sent with high fees to encourage miners to process them first. But this will not prevent front-running if the arbitrage opportunity is high, nor can it prevent arbitrage by the miners themselves. Some exchanges have thus resorted to implementing more heavyweight “speed- bumps,” such as queuing user transactions for a number of blocks before processing them, or retroactively adjusting prices when a new oracle report arrives. The disadvan- tages of these solutions are that they add complexity to the exchange implementation, increase storage requirements and thus transaction costs, and disrupt the user experi- ence as asset exchanges are only confirmed after a significant time period. Piggybacking: Before moving on to FSS, we discuss piggybacking, a quite simple and elegant solution to the oracle front-running problem. It is not applicable to address front-running in other scenarios, however. In short, instead of periodically sending reports to the on-chain contract, oracles publish signed reports that users append to their transactions when buying or selling on-chain assets. The exchange then simply checks that the report is valid and fresh (e.g., the oracle can sign a range of blocks for which the report is valid), and extracts the relevant price feed from it. This simple approach has a number of advantages over the above “speed bump” approach: (1) The exchange contract need not keep state of price feeds, which should lead to lower transaction costs; (2) As oracle reports are posted on chain on a by- need basis, oracles can generate more frequent updates (e.g., every minute), thereby minimizing arbitrage opportunities from front-running a report9; (3) Transactions can be validated immediately, as they always include a fresh price feed. The approach is not perfect, however. First, this piggybacking solution puts the onus on the exchange’s users to fetch up-to-date oracle reports and attach them to their transactions. Second, while piggybacking minimizes arbitrage opportunities, it cannot fully prevent them without affecting the liveness of the on-chain contract. Indeed, if an oracle report is valid until some block number n, then a transaction submitted to block n + 1 would require a new valid report. Due to inherent delays in the propagation of reports from oracles to users, the new report that is valid for block n + 1 would have 9Arbitrage is only worthwhile if the exploitable difference in asset prices exceeds the extraneous fees required to buy and sell the assets, e.g., those collected by miners and the exchange. to be publicized some period before block n + 1 is mined, say at block n −k, thereby creating a sequence of k blocks where a short-lived arbitrage opportunity exists. We now describe how FSS gets around these limitations. Prioritizing oracle reports with FSS: FSS can address the oracle front-running problem by building upon the above piggybacking solution, but pushing the additional work of augmenting transactions with oracle reports to the Decentralized Oracle Net- work.

At a high level, oracle nodes collect transactions destined for an on-chain exchange, agree on a real-time price feed, and post the price feed along with the collected trans- actions to the main-chain contract. Conceptually, one can think of this approach as a “data-augmented transaction batching”, where the oracle ensures that an up-to-date price feed is always added to transactions. FSS solutions can be implemented transparently to the exchange’s users, and with minimal changes to contract logic, as we describe in more detail in Section 5.2. Ensuring that fresh oracle reports are always prioritized over user transactions is just one example of an ordering policy that FSS can adopt and enforce. Policies of FSS for ensuring order fairness are described more generally in Section 5.3. 5.1.2 Front-Running User Transactions We now turn to front-running in generic applications, where the defense method above does not work. The problem can be captured broadly through the following scenario: An adversary sees some user transaction tx1 sent into the P2P network and injects its own adversarial transaction tx2, so that tx2 is processed before tx1 (e.g., by paying a higher transaction fee). For instance, this kind of front-running is common among bots that exploit arbitrage opportunities in DeFi systems [90] and has affected users of various decentralized applications [101]. Imposing a fair order among the transactions processed on the blockchain addresses this problem. More fundamentally, seeing the details of tx1 is sometimes not even necessary and knowledge of its mere existence may allow an adversary to front-run tx1 through its own tx2 and defraud the innocent user that created tx1. For example, the user might be known to trade a particular asset at regular times. Preventing such attacks requires mitigations that avoid leakage of metadata as well [62]. Some solutions for this problem exist, but they introduce delays and usability concerns. From network-order to finalized-order with FSS: Opportunities for front-running arise because existing systems have no mechanisms to ensure that the order in which transactions appear on chain respects the order of events and the information flow outside the network. This represents a problem arising from deficiencies in the imple- mentation of applications (e.g., trading platforms) on a blockchain. Ideally, one would ensure that transactions are committed on the blockchain in the same order as they were created and sent to the blockchain’s P2P network. But since the blockchain network is distributed, no such order can be captured. FSS therefore introduces mechanisms to safeguard against violations of fairness, which arise only because of the distributed nature of the blockchain network. 5.2 FSS Details Figure 12: Order-fair mempool with two different transaction paths: direct and mempool-based.

Depending on the ordering method used for transaction se- quencing, additional protocol steps are needed, as described in the next section. 5.2.1 Transaction Processing Transaction monitoring: We envision two different approaches for FSS to monitor user transactions destined for a specific smart contract, direct and mempool-based: • Direct: The direct approach is conceptually simplest, but requires changes to user clients so that transactions are sent directly to the Decentralized Oracle Network nodes, rather than to the nodes of the main chain. The DON collects user transactions destined to a specific smart contract SC and orders them based on some ordering policy. The DON then sends the ordered transactions to the smart contract on the main chain. Some ordering mechanisms also require the di- rect approach because the user that creates a transaction must cryptographically protect it before sending it to FSS. • Mempool-based: To facilitate the integration of FSS with legacy clients, the DON can use Mempool Services (MS) to monitor the main chain’s mempool and collect transactions. Direct transmission is likely to be the preferred implementation for many contracts, and we believe it should be fairly practical in many cases. We briefly discuss how existing DApps could be minimally modified to support direct transmission while preserving a good user experience. We describe approaches using Ethereum and MetaMask [6] since these are the most popular choices today, but the mentioned techniques should extend to other chains and wallets. A recent Ethereum Improvement Proposal, “EIP-3085: Wallet add Ethereum chain RPC method” [100], will make it easy to target custom Ethereum chains (using a different CHAIN ID than that of MAINCHAIN to prevent replay attacks) from MetaMask and other browser- based wallets. After implementation of this proposal, a DApp seeking to use a DON would simply add a single method call to their front-end to be able to directly transmit transactions to any DON exposing an Ethereum-compatible API. In the meantime, “EIP-712: Ethereum typed structured data hashing and signing” [49] provides a slightly more involved but already widely deployed alternative, where a DApp user can use MetaMask to sign structured data specifying a DON transaction. The DApp can send this signed structured data to the DON. Finally, we note that hybrid approaches are also possible. For example, legacy clients can continue to send transactions into the main chain’s mempool, but critical transactions (e.g., oracle reports) are sent to DON nodes directly (in particular, the set of nodes providing oracle reports such as price-feed updates and the set of nodes providing FSS may overlap or be identical). Transaction sequencing: The main purpose of FSS is to guarantee that user trans- actions are ordered according to a pre-defined policy. The nature of this policy will depend on the application’s needs and the types of unfair transaction orderings that it aims to prevent. Since FSS on the DON is capable of processing data and maintaining local state, they may impose an arbitrary sequencing policy based on the information that is available at the oracles. The particular ordering policies and their implementation are discussed subse- quently in Section 5.3. Transaction posting:'},\n",

The particular ordering policies and their implementation are discussed subse- quently in Section 5.3. Transaction posting: After collecting and ordering user transactions, received ei- ther directly from users or collected from the mempool, the DON sends these trans- actions to the main chain. As such, a DON’s interactions with the main chain remain subject to (potentially unfair) transaction ordering governed by the main chain’s min- ers. To harness the benefits of decentralized transaction ordering, the target smart contract SC thus has to be designed to treat the DON as a “first-class” citizen. We distinguish two approaches: • DON-only contracts: The simplest design option is to have the main chain smart contract SC only accept transactions that have been processed by the DON. This ensures that the smart contract processes transactions in the order proposed by the DON, but de-facto restricts the smart contract to operating in a committee- based system (i.e., the DON committee now has ongoing power to determine the ordering and inclusion of transactions). • Dual-class contracts: A preferred, more granular design has the main chain smart contract SC accept transactions originating both from the DON and from legacy users,10 but places traditional “speed bumps” on transactions that were not pro- cessed by the DON. For example, transactions from the DON may be processed immediately, whereas legacy transactions get “buffered” by the smart contract for a fixed period of time. Other standard mechanisms for preventing front-running such as commit-reveal schemes or VDFs [53] could also be applied to legacy transactions. This ensures that DON-ordered transactions do get processed in the order agreed upon, without giving the DON the unwanted power to censor transactions. As the imposition of transaction ordering by FSS requires that transactions are ag- gregated “off-chain,” this solution is naturally combined with other aggregation tech- niques that aim to reduce on-chain processing costs. For example, after collecting and ordering transactions, the DON may send these transactions to the main chain as a single “batched transaction” (e.g., a rollup), thereby reducing the aggregate transaction fee. Enforcing the transaction order: Whether in a DON-only or dual-class design, the main chain smart contract SC and the DON have to be co-designed so as to guar- antee that the DON’s transaction ordering is upheld. Here also, we envision different design options: • Sequence numbers: The DON can append a sequence number to each transac- tion, and send these transactions into the main chain’s mempool. The main 10If the DON’s transaction monitoring is based on the mempool, legacy transactions must be dis- tinguishable from DON transactions so that they are not collected by the DON, e.g., via a special tag embedded in the transaction or by specifying a particular gas price, e.g. DON transactions have gas prices below a certain threshold. chain smart contract SC ignores transactions that arrive “out-of-sequence.” We note that in this setting, the main-chain miners can decide to ignore the DON’s transaction ordering, thereby causing transactions to fail. It is possible by keep- ing (expensive) state for SC to enforce correct transaction ordering, somewhat analogously to how TCP buffers out-of-order packets until missing'},\n",

It is possible by keep- ing (expensive) state for SC to enforce correct transaction ordering, somewhat analogously to how TCP buffers out-of-order packets until missing packets are received. • Transaction nonces: For many blockchains, and in particular for Ethereum, the above sequence-numbering approach can leverage built-in transaction nonces to enforce that the main-chain smart contract SC processes transactions in sequence. Here, the DON nodes send transactions to the main chain through a single main- chain account, protected with a key shared among the DON nodes. The account’s transaction nonce ensures that transactions are mined and processed in the cor- rect order. • Aggregate transactions: The DON can aggregate multiple transactions in a rollup (or in a bundle similar to a rollup). The main-chain smart contract needs to be designed to handle such aggregate transactions. • Aggregate transactions with a main chain proxy: Here, the DON similarly bun- dles transactions into one “meta-transaction” for the main chain, but relies on a custom proxy smart contract to unpack the transactions and relay them to the target contract SC. This technique can be useful for legacy compatibility. Meta- transactions act like rollups but differ in that they consist of an uncompressed list of transactions posted once to the main chain. The last design has the advantage of seamlessly supporting user transactions that are themselves proxied through a main chain contract before reaching the DON’s target contract SC. For example, consider a user who sends a transaction to some wallet contract, which in turn sends an internal transaction to SC. Assigning a sequence number to such a transaction would be tricky, unless the user’s wallet contract is specially designed to forward the sequence number with every internal transaction to SC. Similarly, such internal transactions cannot be easily aggregated into a meta- transaction that is sent directly to SC. We discuss further design considerations for such proxied transactions below. 5.2.2 Transaction Atomicity Our discussion thus far has implicitly assumed that transactions interact with a single on-chain smart contract (e.g., a user sends a buy request to an exchange). Yet, in systems such as Ethereum, a single transaction can consist of multiple internal trans- actions, e.g., one smart contract calling a function in another contract. Below, we describe two high-level strategies for sequencing “multi-contract” transactions, while preserving the atomicity of the transaction (i.e., the sequence of actions prescribed by the transaction are all executed in the correct order, or not at all). Strong atomicity: The simplest solution is to apply FSS, as described above, di- rectly to entire “multi-contract” transactions. That is, users send their transactions into the network and FSS monitors, sequences, and posts these transactions to the main chain. This approach is technically simple, but has one potential limitation: If a user transaction interacts with two contracts SC1 and SC2 that both want to leverage fair sequencing services, then the sequencing policy of these two contracts has to be con- sistent. That is, given two different transactions tx1 and tx2 that each interacts with both SC1 and SC2, it must not be the case that the policy of SC1 orders tx1 before tx2 whereas the policy of SC2 prescribes'},\n",

That is, given two different transactions tx1 and tx2 that each interacts with both SC1 and SC2, it must not be the case that the policy of SC1 orders tx1 before tx2 whereas the policy of SC2 prescribes the opposite order. For the vast majority of scenarios of interest, we envision that the sequencing poli- cies adopted by different contracts will be consistent. For example, both SC1 and SC2 may want transactions to be ordered by their approximate arrival time in the mempool, and SC1 may further want certain oracle reports to always be delivered first. As the latter oracle report transactions do not interact with SC2, the policies are consistent. Weak atomicity: In its full generality, FSS could be applied at the level of individual internal transactions. Consider transactions of the form tx = { ˜txpre, ˜txSC, ˜txpost}, consisting of some initial transaction(s) ˜txpre, which results in an internal transaction ˜txSC to SC, which in turn issues internal transaction(s) ˜txpost. The sequencing policy of SC might determine how the internal transaction ˜txSC has to be ordered with respect to other transactions sent to SC, but leave open the sequencing order for ˜txpre and ˜txpost. Given the intrinsics of transaction processing in systems such as Ethereum, devel- oping a sequencing service that targets specific internal transactions is not straightfor- ward. With a specially designed contract SC, this may be realizable as follows: 1. The transaction tx is sent into the network and mined (without any sequencing performed by FSS). The initial ˜txpre is executed, and calls ˜txSC. 2. SC does not execute ˜txSC and returns. 3. FSS monitors internal transactions to SC, sequences them, and posts them back to SC (i.e., by sending transactions ˜txSC directly to SC). 4. SC processes the transactions ˜txSC received from FSS, and issues internal trans- actions ˜txpost that result from ˜txSC. With this approach, transactions are not executed fully atomically (i.e., the original transaction tx gets broken up into multiple on-chain transactions), but the ordering of internal transactions is preserved. This solution entails a number of design constraints. For example, ˜txpre cannot assume that ˜txSC and ˜txpost will be executed. Moreover, SC should be designed so as to execute transactions ˜txSC and ˜txpost on behalf of a certain user, even though they were sent by FSS. For these reasons, the more coarse-grained “Strong Atomicity” solution above is likely preferable in practice. For respecting more complex dependencies, involving multiple transactions and their respective internal transactions, the transaction scheduler of FSS may contain elaborate functions that resemble those found in transaction managers of relational database managers. 5.3 Fair Transaction Sequencing Here we discuss two notions of fairness for transaction sequencing and the correspond- ing implementations, which may be realized by FSS: order-fairness based on a policy imposed by FSS and secure causality preservation, which requires additional crypto- graphic methods in FSS. Order-fairness: Order-fairness is a notion of temporal fairness in consensus protocols that has first been introduced formally by Kelkar et al. [144]. Kelkar et al. aim to achieve a form of natural policy in which transactions are ordered based on the time they are first received by the DON (or the P2P network, in the case of a mempool-based FSS).

Kelkar et al. aim to achieve a form of natural policy in which transactions are ordered based on the time they are first received by the DON (or the P2P network, in the case of a mempool-based FSS). In a decentralized system, however, different nodes may see transactions arrive in a different order. Establishing a total order on all transactions is the very problem solved by the consensus protocol underlying MAINCHAIN. Kelkar et al. [144] therefore introduce a weaker notion that can be achieved with the help of a Decentralized Oracle Network, called “block-order fairness.” It groups the transactions that the DON has received during a time interval into a “block” and inserts all transactions of the block concurrently and at the same position (i.e., height) into MAINCHAIN. They are thus ordered together and must be executable in parallel, without creating any conflicts among them. Roughly speaking, order- fairness then states that if a large fraction of nodes see transaction τ1 before τ2, then τ1 will be sequenced before or in the same block as τ2. By imposing such a coarse granularity on transaction order, the opportunities for front-running and other order- related attacks are greatly reduced. Kelkar et al. propose a family of protocols called Aequitas [144], which address different deployment models, including synchronous, partially synchronous, and asyn- chronous network settings. Aequitas protocols impose significant communication over- head relative to basic BFT consensus and are therefore not ideal for practical use. We believe, however, that practical variants of Aequitas will emerge that can be used for transaction sequencing in FSS and other applications. Some related schemes have already been proposed that have less accompanying formalism and weaker properties, e.g., [36, 151, 236], but better practical performance. These schemes can be supported in FSS as well. It is also worth noting that the term “fairness” appears elsewhere in the blockchain literature with a different meaning, namely fairness in the sense of opportunity for miners proportional to their committed resources [106, 181] or for validators in terms of equal opportunity [153]. Secure causality preservation: The most widely known approach to prevent front- running and other ordering violations in distributed platforms relies on cryptographic techniques. Their common feature is to hide the transaction data itself, waiting until the order at the consensus layer has been established, and to reveal the transaction data later for processing. This preserves the causal order among the transactions that are executed by the blockchain. The relevant security notions and cryptographic protocols have been developed considerably before the advent of blockchains [71, 190]. The security conditions of “input causality” [190] and “secure causality preserva- tion” [71, 97] require formally that no information about a transaction becomes known before the position of this transaction in the global order has been determined. An ad- versary must not be able to infer any information until that time, in a cryptographically strong sense. One can distinguish four cryptographic techniques to preserve causality: • Commit-reveal protocols [29, 142, 145]: Instead of a transaction being announced in the clear, only a cryptographic commitment to the transaction is broadcast.

Af- ter all committed but hidden transactions have been ordered (in early blockchain systems on MAINCHAIN itself, but here by FSS), the sender must open the com- mitment and reveal the transaction data within a predetermined time interval. The network then verifies that the opening satisfies the earlier commitment. The origins of this method date prior to the advent of blockchains. Although it is particularly simple, the approach introduces considerable draw- backs and is not easy to employ for two reasons. First, since only the commit- ment exists at the level of the ordering protocol, the semantics of the transaction cannot be validated during consensus. An additional round-trip to the client is required. More severely, though, weighs the possibility that no opening may ever arrive, which could amount to a denial-of-service attack. Furthermore, it is difficult to determine whether the opening is valid in a consistent, distributed manner because all participants must agree on whether the opening arrived in time. • Commit-reveal protocols with delayed recovery [145]: One challenge with the commit-reveal approach is that a client may commit to a transaction specu- latively and reveal it later only if subsequent transactions make it profitable. A recent variant of the commit-reveal approach improves the resilience against this kind of misbehavior. In particular, the TEX protocol [145] addresses this problem using a clever approach in which encrypted transactions include a decryption key obtainable by computing a verifiable delay function (VDF) [53, 221]. If a client fails to decrypt her transaction in a timely way, others in the system will decrypt it on her behalf by solving a moderately hard cryptographic puzzle. • Threshold encryption [71, 190]: This method exploits that the DON may perform threshold-cryptographic operations. Assume FSS maintains an encryption public key pkO and the oracles share the corresponding private key among themselves. Clients then encrypt transactions under pkO and send them to FSS. FSS orders transactions on the DON, then decrypts them, and finally injects them into MAINCHAIN in the fixed order. Encryption therefore ensures that ordering is not based on the transaction content, but that the data itself is available when needed. This method was originally proposed by Reiter and Birman [190] and later re- fined by Cachin et al. [71], where it was integrated with a permissioned consensus protocol. More recent work has explored the use of threshold cryptography as a consensus-level mechanism for generic messages [33, 97] and for general compu- tations with shared data [41]. Compared to commit-reveal protocols, threshold encryption prevents simple denial- of-service attacks (although care is required given the computational cost of de- cryption). It lets the DON proceed autonomously, at its own speed and without waiting for further client actions. Transactions may be validated immediately af- ter they have been decrypted. Moreover, clients encrypt all transactions with one key for the DON and the communication pattern remains the same as with other transactions. Managing the threshold key securely and with changing nodes in O, however, may pose additional difficulties. • Committed secret sharing [97]: Instead of encrypting the transaction data under a key held by the DON, the client may also secret-share it for the nodes in O.'},\n",

Managing the threshold key securely and with changing nodes in O, however, may pose additional difficulties. • Committed secret sharing [97]: Instead of encrypting the transaction data under a key held by the DON, the client may also secret-share it for the nodes in O. Using a hybrid, computationally secure secret sharing scheme, the transaction is encrypted first using a symmetric cipher with a random key. Only the corre- sponding symmetric key is shared and the ciphertext is submitted to the DON. The client must send one key share to each node in O using a separately en- crypted message. The remaining protocol steps are the same as with threshold encryption, except that the transaction data is decrypted with the symmetric algorithm after reconstructing the per-transaction key from its shares. This method does not require setup or management of a public-key cryptosystem associated with the DON. However, the clients must be aware of the nodes in O and communicate in a secure context with each one of them, which places additional burden on the clients. Although the cryptographic methods offer complete protection against information leaking from submitted transactions to the network, they do not conceal metadata. For example, an IP address or an Ethereum address of the sender could still be used by an adversary to perform front-running and other attacks. Various privacy-enhancing techniques deployed at the network layer, e.g., [52, 95, 107], or the transaction layer, e.g., [13, 65], would be needed to accomplish this goal. The impact of a particular piece of metadata, namely to which contract a transaction is sent, can be (partially) concealed through multiplexing many contracts on the same DON. Cryptographic concealment of transactions per se also doesn’t prevent prioritization of transactions by corrupted DON nodes in collusion with transaction senders. Secure causality as guaranteed by cryptographic protocols complement the order- fairness guarantees for any policy, and we intend to explore a combination of the two methods, where this is possible. If an adversary cannot gain significant advantage from observing metadata, the secure causality-preservation protocols could be used alongside a na¨ıve ordering approach as well. For example, oracle nodes can write transactions to L as soon as they receive them, without duplication. Transactions would then be ordered according to their appearance on L and subsequently decrypted. We also plan to consider the use of TEEs as a way to help enforce fair ordering; for example, Tesseract [44] may be viewed as achieving a form of causal ordering, but one strengthened by the ability of the TEE to process transactions in explicit form while retaining their confidentiality. 5.4 Network-Layer Considerations So far, our description of FSS has mainly focused on the problem of enforcing that the finalized order of transactions matches their observed order in the network. Hereafter, we consider fairness issues that could arise at the network layer itself. High-frequency traders in conventional electronic marketplaces invest considerable resources to obtain superior network speed [64], and traders in cryptocurrency ex- changes exhibit similar behavior [90]. Network speed confers an advantage both in observing the transactions of other parties and in submitting competing transactions.

Network speed confers an advantage both in observing the transactions of other parties and in submitting competing transactions. One remedy deployed in practice and popularized in the book Flash Boys [155] is the “speed bump” introduced initially in the IEX exchange [128] and later in other exchanges [179] (with mixed results [19]). This mechanism imposes a delay (350 mi- croseconds in IEX) on access to the market, with the aim of neutralizing advantages in speed. Empirical evidence, e.g. [128], supports its efficacy in decreasing certain trading costs for ordinary investors. FSS can be used simply to implement an asymmetrical speed bump-one that delays incoming transactions. Budish, Cramton, and Shim [64] argue that exploitation of advantages in speed is inescapable in continuous-time markets, and argue for a structural remedy in the form of batch-auction-based markets. But this approach has not taken hold broadly in existing trading platforms. Conventional trading systems are centralized, typically receiving transactions through a single network connection. In a decentralized system, by contrast, it is possible to observe transaction propagation from multiple vantage points. Consequently, it is pos- sible to observe behaviors such as network flooding in a P2P network. We intend to explore network-layer approaches to FSS that help developers to specify policies prohibiting such undesirable network behaviors. 5.5 Entity-Level Fairness Policies Order-fairness and secure causality aim at enforcing an ordering on transactions that respects the time when they were created and first submitted to the network. A limita- tion of this notion of fairness is that it does not prevent attacks in which an adversary gains an advantage by flooding a system with many transactions, a strategy observed in the wild as a way to perform effective transaction sniping in token sales [159] and to create congestion resulting in liquidation of collateralized debt positions (CDPs) [48]. In other words, order-fairness enforces fairness with respect to transactions, not players. As shown in the CanDID system [160], it is possible to use oracle tools such as DECO or Town Crier in conjunction with a committee of nodes (such as a DON) to achieve various forms of Sybil-resistance while protecting privacy. Users can register identities and provide evidence of their uniqueness without disclosing the identities themselves. Sybil-resistant credentials offer a possible approach to enriching transaction-ordering policies in a way that would limit opportunities for flooding attacks. For example, a token sale might permit only one transaction per registered user, where registration requires a proof of uniqueness of a national identifier, such as a Social Security Number. Such an approach isn’t foolproof, but may prove a useful policy to mitigate transaction- flooding attacks. The DON Transaction-Execution Framework (DON-TEF) DONs will provide oracle and decentralized-resource support for layer-2 solutions within what we call the Decentralized Oracle Network Transaction-Execution Framework (DON- TEF) or TEF for short. Today, the frequency of updates to DeFi contracts is limited by main chain latencies, e.g., the 10-15 second average block interval in Ethereum [104]-as well as the cost of pushing large amounts of data on chain and limited computational/tx throughput- motivating scaling approaches such as sharding [148, 158, 232] and layer-2 execution [5, 12, 121, 141, 169, 186, 187].

Even blockchains with much faster transaction times, e.g., [120], have proposed scaling strategies that involve off-chain computation [168]. TEF is meant to act as a layer-2 resource for any such layer-1 / MAINCHAIN systems. Using TEF, DONs can support faster updates in a MAINCHAIN contract while retaining the key trust assurances provided by the main chain. TEF can support any of a number of layer-2 execution techniques and paradigms, including rollups,11 optimistic rollups, Validium, etc., as well as a threshold trust model in which DON nodes execute transactions. The TEF is complementary to FSS and intended to support it. In other words, any application running in the TEF can use FSS. 11Often called “zk-rollups,” a misnomer, as they do not necessarily need zero-knowledge proofs. 6.1 TEF Overview The TEF is a design pattern for the construction and execution of a performant hybrid smart contract SC. In accordance with the main idea behind hybrid smart contracts, TEF involves a decomposition of SC into two pieces: (1) What we call in the TEF context an anchor contract SCa on MAINCHAIN and (2) DON logic exect that we call the TEF executable. We use SC here to denote the logical contract implemented by the combination of SCa and exect. (As noted above, we expect to develop compiler tools to decompose a contract SC automatically into these components.) The TEF executable exect is the engine that processes users’ transactions in SC. It can execute in a performant way, as it runs on the DON. It has several functions: • Transaction ingestion: exect receives or fetches users’ transactions. It can do so directly, i.e., through transaction submission on the DON, or via the MAINCHAIN mempool using MS. • Fast transaction execution: exect processes transactions involving assets within SC. It does so locally, i.e., on the DON. • Fast and low-cost oracle / adapter access: exect has native access to oracle reports and other adapter data leading to, e.g., faster, cheaper, and more accurate asset pricing than MAINCHAIN execution. Moreover, off-chain oracle access reduces the oracle’s operational cost, hence the cost of using the system, by avoiding expensive on-chain storage. • Syncing: exect periodically pushes updates from DON onto MAINCHAIN, updat- ing SCa. The anchor contract is the MAINCHAIN front end of SC. As the higher-trust com- ponent of SC, it serves several purposes: • Asset custody: Users’ funds are deposited into, held in, and withdrawn from SCa. • Syncing verification: SCa may verify the correctness of state updates when exect syncs, e.g., SNARKs attached to rollups. • Guard rails: SCa may include provisions to protect against corruption or failures in exect. (See Section 7 for more details.) In TEF, users’ funds are custodied on MAINCHAIN, meaning the DON is itself non- custodial. Depending on the choice of syncing mechanism (see below), users may need to trust the DON only for accurate oracle reports and timely syncing with MAINCHAIN. The resulting trust model is very similar to that for order-book-based DEXes, e.g., [2], which today generally include an off-chain component for order matching and an on- chain component for clearing and settlement.

The resulting trust model is very similar to that for order-book-based DEXes, e.g., [2], which today generally include an off-chain component for order matching and an on- chain component for clearing and settlement. To use the vocabulary of payment systems, one may think of exect as the component of SC responsible for clearing, while SCa handles settlement. See Fig. 13 for a schematic depiction of TEF. Figure 13: TEF schematic. In this example, transactions pass through the mempool of MAINCHAIN via MS to the DON. TEF benefits: TEF carries three main benefits: • High performance: SC inherits the DON’s much higher throughput than MAINCHAIN for both transactions and oracle reports. Additionally, exect can process transac- tions faster and respond to oracle reports in a more timely way than an imple- mentation on MAINCHAIN alone. • Lower fees: The process of syncing is less time-sensitive than transaction pro- cessing, and transactions can be sent from the DON to MAINCHAIN in batches. Consequently, the per-transaction on-chain fees (e.g., gas costs) with this ap- proach are much lower than for a contract that runs only on MAINCHAIN. • Confidentiality: The confidentiality mechanisms of the DON can be brought to bear on SC. TEF limitations: One limitation of TEF is that it does not support instantaneous withdrawals, as they occur only on MAINCHAIN: Upon sending a withdrawal request to SCa, a user may need to wait for exect to perform a state update that includes the withdrawal transaction before it can be approved. We discuss some partial remedies, however, in Section 6.2. Another limitation of TEF is that it does not support atomic composition of DeFi contracts on MAINCHAIN, specifically the ability to route assets through multiple DeFi contracts in a single transaction. TEF can, however, support such atomicity among DeFi contracts running on the same DON. We also discuss some ways to address this problem in Section 6.2. 6.2 Transaction Routing Transactions for SC can be sent by users directly to the DON or can be routed through the mempool in MAINCHAIN (via FSS). There are four distinct transaction types, each of which requires different handling: Within-contract transactions: Because it sidesteps the complications of gas dy- namics, TEF provides SC more flexibility in its handling of transactions than would be available in a layer-1 contract. For example, while a mempool transaction in Ethereum can be overwritten by a fresh transaction with a higher gas price, SC can treat a trans- action that operates on assets within SC as authoritative as soon as it becomes visible in the mempool. Consequently, SC need not wait for a transaction to be confirmed within a block, resulting in considerably reduced latency. Proxying: A user may wish to send a transaction τ to SC via a wallet contract or other contract on MAINCHAIN. It is possible for the DON to simulate execution of τ on MAINCHAIN to determine whether it results in a follow-on transaction to SC. If so, τ can be sequenced with other transactions for SC that do. There are a few possibilities for how the DON identifies such transactions: (1) The DON can simulate all transactions in the mempool (an expensive approach); (2) Certain contracts or contract types, e.g., wallets, can be listed for monitoring'},\n",

There are a few possibilities for how the DON identifies such transactions: (1) The DON can simulate all transactions in the mempool (an expensive approach); (2) Certain contracts or contract types, e.g., wallets, can be listed for monitoring by the DON; or (3) Users can annotate transactions for DON inspection. Matters become more complicated when a single transaction interacts with two contracts, SC1 and SC2, both of which use Fair Sequencing Services and have incom- patible ordering policies. The DON might, for example, sequence τ at the latest time that is compatible with both. Deposits: A transaction depositing a MAINCHAIN asset into SC needs to be con- firmed in a block before SC can treat it as valid. When it detects the mining of a transaction that sends assets (e.g., Ether) into SCa, exect can instantly confirm the deposit. For example, it can apply a current oracle-reported price on the DON to the asset. Withdrawals: As noted above, a limitation of TEF is that withdrawals cannot al- ways be executed instantaneously. In a rollup-type execution model, the withdrawal request must be sequenced with other transactions, i.e., rolled up, in order to be safely processed. There are, however, some partial remedies to this limitation. If the DON can quickly compute a rollup validity proof up to the withdrawal trans- action, then observing a user’s transaction τ in the mempool exect can send a state- update transaction τ ′ for τ at a higher gas price, a kind of beneficial front-running. Provided that τ isn’t mined before τ ′ reaches the mempool, τ ′ will precede τ, and τ will effect an approved withdrawal. In a TEF variant where the DON is relied upon to compute state updates (see the threshold signing variant below), the DON can alternatively determine off-chain whether τ ought to be approved given the state of SC upon its execution. The DON can then send a transaction τ ′ that approves withdrawal τ-without effecting a full state update. If this approach isn’t possible, or in cases where it doesn’t succeed, a DON-initiated transaction τ ′ can send funds to the user in response to τ so that the user need not initiate an additional transaction. 6.3 Syncing The TEF executable exect periodically pushes updates from DON to MAINCHAIN, updating the state of SCa in a process we refer to as syncing. Syncing may be thought of as propagation of layer-2 transactions to layer-1, so TEF can draw on any of a number of existing techniques for this purpose, including rollups [5, 12, 16, 69], optimistic rollups [10, 11, 141], Validium [201], or basic threshold signing, e.g., threshold BLS, Schnorr, or ECDSA [24, 54, 116, 202]. In principle, trusted execution environments can also attest to the correctness of state changes, offering a much more performant alternative to rollups, but with a hardware-dependent trust model. (See, e.g., [80].) Below we compare these syncing options with respect to three key properties in TEF: • Data availability: Where is the state of SC stored? At least three options are available in TEF: on the MAINCHAIN, on a DON, or by some third-party storage providers such as IPFS.

Briefly, storing state on the MAINCHAIN enables on-chain auditability and eliminates reliance on any party for state availability; on the other hand, storing state off-chain can reduce storage cost and improve throughput, at the cost of trusting storage providers (DON or third parties) for data availability. Of course, flexible models that combine these options are also possible. We indicate the required form of data availability in Table 1. • Correctness guarantees: How does SCa ascertain the correctness of the updates pushed by exect? This affects the computational load on exect and SCa and the syncing latency (see below). • Latency: Syncing latency has three contributing factors: (1) The time taken for exect to generate a syncing transaction τsync; (2) The time taken for τsync to be confirmed on MAINCHAIN; and (3) The time for τsync to take effect on SCa. In TEF, latency is particularly important for withdrawals (but less so for within-contract transactions) because withdrawals necessarily require an (at least partial) state sync.

Table 1 summarizes these properties in the five main syncing options in TEF. (Note that we do not intend to compare these technologies as standalone layer-2 scaling solutions. For that we refer readers to e.g., [121].) Now we discuss each syncing option. Rollups: A rollup [69] is a protocol in which the state transition effected by a batch of transactions is computed off-chain. The state change is then propagated onto MAINCHAIN. To implement rollups, the anchor smart contract SCa stores a compact represen- tation Rstate (e.g., a Merkle root) of the actual state. To sync, exect sends τsync = (T, R′ state) to SCa where T is the set of the transactions it processed since the last sync and R′ state is the compact representation of the new state calculated by applying transactions in T to the previous state Rstate. There are two popular variants that differ in how SCa verifies state updates in τsync. The first, (zk-)rollups, attach a succinct argument of correctness, sometimes called a validity proof, for the transition Rstate →R′ state. To implement this variant, exect computes and submits the validity proof (e.g., a zk-SNARK proof) along with τsync, proving that R′ state is the result of applying T to the current state of SCa. The anchor contract accepts the state update only after it has verified the proof. Optimistic rollups do not include arguments of correctness, but have staking and challenge procedures that facilitate distributed verification of state transitions. For this rollup variant, SCa tentatively accepts τsync assuming it is'},\n",

The anchor contract accepts the state update only after it has verified the proof. Optimistic rollups do not include arguments of correctness, but have staking and challenge procedures that facilitate distributed verification of state transitions. For this rollup variant, SCa tentatively accepts τsync assuming it is correct (hence the optimism) but τsync does not take effect until after a challenge period, during which any party monitoring MAINCHAIN can identify erroneous state updates and inform SCa to take necessary actions (e.g., to rollback the state and inflict a penalty on exect.) Both rollup variants achieve on-chain data availability, as transactions are posted on-chain, from which the full state can be constructed. The latency of zk-rollups is dominated by the time needed to generate validity proofs, which typically is on the order of minutes in existing systems [16] and will likely see improvements over time. Optimistic rollups, on the other hand, have a higher latency (e.g., days or weeks) because the challenge period needs to be long enough for fraud proofs to work. The implication of slow confirmation is subtle and sometimes specific to the scheme, so that a thorough analysis is out of scope. For instance, certain schemes consider payment transactions as “trustless final” [109] before the state update is confirmed, since a regular user could verify a rollup much more quickly than the MAINCHAIN. Validium: Validium is a form of (zk-)rollup that makes data available off-chain only and does not maintain all data on MAINCHAIN. Specifically, exect sends only the new state and the proof but not transactions to SCa. With Validium-style syncing, exect and the DON that executes it are the only parties that store the complete state and that execute transactions. As with zk-rollups, syncing latency is dominated by validity proof generation time. Unlike zk-rollups, however, Validium style syncing reduces the storage cost and increases the throughput. Threshold signing by DON: Assuming a threshold of DON nodes is honest, a simple and fast syncing option is to have DON nodes collectively sign the new state. This approach can support both on-chain and off-chain data availability. Note that if users trust DON for oracle updates, they do not need to trust it more for accepting state updates, as they are already in a threshold trust model. Another benefit of threshold signing is low latency. Support for new transaction signature formats as proposed in EIP-2938 [70] and known as account abstraction would make threshold signing considerably easier to implement, as it would eliminate the need for threshold ECDSA, which involves considerably more complex protocols (e.g., [116, 117, 118]) than alternatives such as threshold Schnorr [202] or BLS [55] signatures. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): TEEs are isolated execution environ- ments (usually realized by hardware) that aim to provide strong security protections for programs running inside. Some TEEs (e.g., Intel SGX [84]) can produce proofs, known as attestations, that an output is correctly computed by a specific program for a particular input12. A TEE-based variant of TEF syncing can be implemented by replacing proofs in (zk-)rollups or Validium with TEE attestations using techniques from [80]. Compared to zero-knowledge proofs used in rollups and Validium, TEEs are much more performant. Compared to threshold signing, TEEs remove the complexity of generating threshold ECDSA signatures as there need in principle be'},\n",

Using TEEs does, however, introduce extra hardware-dependent trust as- sumptions. One can also combine TEEs with threshold signing to create resilience against compromise of a fraction of TEE instances, although this protective measure reintroduces the complexity of generating threshold ECDSA signatures. Additional flexibility: These syncing options can be refined to provide more flexi- bility in the following ways. • Flexible triggering: TEF application can determine the conditions under which syncing is triggered. For example, syncing can be batch-based, e.g., occur after every N transactions, time-based, e.g., every 10 blocks, or event-based, e.g., occur whenever target asset prices move significantly. • Partial syncing: It is possible and in some cases desirable (e.g., with rollups, partial syncing can reduce latency) for exect to provide fast syncing of small amounts of state, performing full syncing perhaps only periodically. For example, exect can approve a withdrawal request by updating a user’s balance in SCa without otherwise updating MAINCHAIN state. 6.4 Reorgs Blockchain reorganizations resulting from network instability or even from 51%-attacks can pose a threat to the integrity of a main chain. In practice, adversaries have used them to mount double-spending attacks [34]. While such attacks on major chains are challenging to mount, they remain feasible for some chains [88]. Because it operates independently of MAINCHAIN, a DON offers the interesting possibility of observing and providing some protections against reorgs associated with attacks. For example, a DON can report to a relying contract SC on MAINCHAIN the ex- istence of a competing fork of some threshold length τ. The DON can additionally 12Supplementary details can be found in Appendix B.2.1. They are not required for understanding. provide proof-in either a PoW or PoS setting-of the existence of such a fork. The contract SC can implement suitable defensive actions, such as suspending further trans- action execution for a period of time (e.g., to allow exchanges to blacklist double-spent assets). Note that although an adversary mounting a 51%-attack can seek to censor reports from a DON, a countermeasure in SC is to require periodic reports from the DON in order to process transactions (i.e., a heartbeat) or to require a fresh report to validate a high-value transaction. While such forking alerts are in principle a general service the DON can provide for any of a number of purposes, our plan is to incorporate them with the TEF. Trust Minimization As a decentralized system with participation from a heterogeneous set of entities, the Chainlink network provides strong protection against failures in both liveness (avail- ability) and safety (report integrity). Most decentralized systems, however, vary in the degree to which their constituent components are themselves decentralized. This is true even of large systems, where limited decentralization among miners [32] and intermediaries [51] has long been present. The goal of any decentralization effort is trust minimization: We seek to reduce the adverse effects of systemic corruption or failure within the Chainlink network, even that due to a malicious DON.

Our guiding principle is the Principle of Least Privilege [197]. System components and actors within the system should have privileges strictly scoped to allow only for the successful completion of their assigned roles. Here we lay out several concrete mechanisms for Chainlink to adopt in its drive toward ever-greater trust minimization. We characterize these mechanisms in terms of the loci, i.e., system components, in which they are rooted, shown in Fig. 14. We address each locus in a respective subsection. 7.1 Data-Source Authentication Current operating models for oracles are constrained by the fact that few data sources digitally sign the data they omit, in large part because TLS does not natively sign data. TLS does make use of digital signatures in its “handshake” protocol (to establish a shared key between a server and client). HTTPS-enabled servers thus have certificates on public keys that can in principle serve to sign data, but they do not generally use these certificates to support data signing. Consequently, the security of a DON, as in today’s oracle networks, relies on oracle nodes faithfully relaying data from a data source to a contract. An important long-term component of our vision for trust minimization in Chain- link involves stronger data-source authentication through support of tools and stan- dards for data signing. Data signing can help enforce end-to-end integrity guarantees. In principle, if a contract accepts as input a piece of data D signed directly by a data Figure 14: Loci of trust-minimizing mechanisms discussed in this section. 1⃝Data sources provide data to the 2⃝DON, which relays a function of the data to a dependent 3⃝smart contract. Additionally, the DON or the oracle network includes 4⃝node management smart contracts on MAINCHAIN for, e.g., compensating nodes, guard rails, and so forth. source, then the oracle network cannot feasibly tamper with D. Various encouraging efforts to enable such signing of data have emerged, including OpenID Connect, which is designed primarily for user authentication [9], TLS-N, an academic project aiming to extend TLS [191] by repurposing TLS certificates, and TLS Evidence Extensions [63]. While OpenID Connect has seen some adoption, however, TLS Evidence Extensions and TLS-N have yet to see adoption. Another potential avenue of data-source authentication is to use publishers’ own Signed HTTP Exchanges (SXG) [230], which they can cache on content-delivery net- works as part of the Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) protocol [225]. The Chrome mo- bile browser displays the content from AMP-cached SXGs as if they were served from their publishers’ own network domains instead of the cache-server domain. This brand- ing incentive, coupled with the relative ease of enabling it using services like Cloud- Flare’s Real URL [83] and Google’s amppackager [124], may lead to widespread adop- tion of SXGs in cached news content, which would enable a simple, tamper-resistant way for Chainlink oracles to trigger on newsworthy events reported in valid SXGs. While AMP-cached SXGs from news publishers would not be useful for high-tempo applications like reports on trading data, they could be a secure source for custom contracts pertaining to real-world'},\n",

This brand- ing incentive, coupled with the relative ease of enabling it using services like Cloud- Flare’s Real URL [83] and Google’s amppackager [124], may lead to widespread adop- tion of SXGs in cached news content, which would enable a simple, tamper-resistant way for Chainlink oracles to trigger on newsworthy events reported in valid SXGs. While AMP-cached SXGs from news publishers would not be useful for high-tempo applications like reports on trading data, they could be a secure source for custom contracts pertaining to real-world events like extreme weather or election outcomes. We believe that simple deployment, mature tools, and flexibility will be vital to accelerating data-source signing. Enabling data providers to use Chainlink nodes as an authenticated API front end seems a promising approach. We intend to create an option for nodes to function in this mode, with or without participation in the network as a full-blown oracle. We refer to this capability as authenticated data origination (ADO). By using Chainlink nodes with ADO, data sources will be able to benefit from the experience and tools developed by the Chainlink community in adding digital signing capabilities to their existing suite of off-chain APIs. Should they choose to run their nodes as oracles, they can additionally open up potential new revenue streams under the same model as existing data providers, e.g., Kraken [28], Kaiko [140], and others, that run Chainlink nodes to sell API data on chain. 7.1.1 The Limitations of Authenticated Data Origination Digital signing by data sources, while it can help strengthen authentication, isn’t suf- ficient per se to accomplish all of the natural security or operational goals of an oracle network. To begin with, a given piece of data D must still be relayed in a robust and timely way from a data source to smart contract or other data consumer. That is, even in an ideal setting in which all data is signed using keys pre-programmed into dependent contracts, a DON would still be needed to communicate the data reliably from sources to contracts. Additionally, there are a number of cases in which contracts or other oracle-data consumers want access to authenticated output of various functions computed over source data for two main reasons: • Confidentiality: A data source API may provide sensitive or proprietary data that needs to be redacted or sanitized before it is made publicly visible on chain. Any modification to signed data, however, invalidated the signature. Put another way, na¨ıve ADO and data sanitization are incompatible. We show in Example 3 how the two can be reconciled through an enhanced form of ADO. • Data source faults: Both errors and failures can affect data sources, and digi- tal signatures address neither problem. From its inception [98], Chainlink has already included a mechanism to remediate such faults: redundancy. The re- ports issued by oracle networks typically represent the combined data of multiple sources. We now discuss schemes we are exploring in the ADO setting to enhance the con- fidentiality of source data and to combine data from multiple sources securely. 7.1.2 Confidentiality Data sources may not anticipate and make available the full gamut of APIs desired by users. Specifically, users may wish to access pre-processed data to help ensure confidentiality. The following example illustrates the problem. Example 3. Alice wishes to obtain a decentralized identity (DID) credential stating that she is over 18 years of age (and thus can, for instance, take out a loan).

Alice wishes to obtain a decentralized identity (DID) credential stating that she is over 18 years of age (and thus can, for instance, take out a loan). To do so, she needs to prove this fact about her age to a DID credential issuer. Alice hopes to use data from her state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) website for the purpose. The DMV has a record of her birthdate and will emit a digitally signed attestation A on it of the following form: A = {Name: Alice, DoB: 02/16/1999}. In this example, the attestation A may be sufficient for Alice to prove to the DID credential issuer that she’s over 18. But it needlessly leaks sensitive information: Alice’s exact DoB. Ideally, what Alice would like from the DMV instead is a signature on a simple statement A′ that “Alice is over 18 years of age.” In other words, she wants the output of a function G on her birthdate X, where (informally), A′ = G(X) = True if CurrentDate −X ≥18 years; otherwise, G(X) = False. To generalize, Alice would like to be able to request from the data source a signed attestation A′ of the form: A′ = {Name: Alice, Func:G(X), Result: True}, where G(X) denotes a specification of a function G and its input(s) X. We envision that a user should be able to provide a desired G(X) as input with her request for a corresponding attestation A′. Note that the data source’s attestation A′ must include the specification G(X) to ensure that A′ is correctly interpreted. In the above example, G(X) defines the meaning of the Boolean value in A′ and thus that True signifies the subject of the attestation is over 18 years of age. We refer to flexible queries in which a user can specify G(X) as functional queries. In order to support use cases like that in Example 3, as well as those involving queries directly from contracts, we intend to include support for functional queries involving simple functions G as part of ADO. 7.1.3 Combining Source Data To reduce on-chain costs, contracts are generally designed to consume combined data from multiple sources, as illustrated in the following example. Example 4 (Medianizing price data). To provide a price feed, i.e., the value of one asset (e.g., ETH) with respect to another (e.g., USD), an oracle network will generally obtain current prices from a number of sources, such as exchanges. The oracle network typically sends to a dependent contract SC the median of these values. In an environment with data signing, a correctly functioning oracle network obtains from data sources S = {S1, . . . , SnS} a sequence of values V = {v1, v2, . . . , vnS} from nS sources with accompanying source-specific signatures Σ = {σ1, σ2, . . . , σnS}. Upon verifying the signatures, it transmits the price v = median(V ) to SC. Unfortunately, there is no simple way for an oracle network to transmit the median value v in Example 4 to SC along with a succinct proof σ∗that v was correctly computed over signed inputs. A na¨ıve approach would be to encode in SC the public keys of all nS data sources. The oracle network'},\n",

Unfortunately, there is no simple way for an oracle network to transmit the median value v in Example 4 to SC along with a succinct proof σ∗that v was correctly computed over signed inputs. A na¨ıve approach would be to encode in SC the public keys of all nS data sources. The oracle network would then relay (V, Σ) and allow SC to compute the median of V . This, however, would result in a proof σ of size O(nS)-i.e., σ∗would not be succinct. It would also incur high gas costs for SC, which would need to verify all signatures in Σ. Use of SNARKs, in contrast, enables a succinct proof of correctly combined au- thenticated source values. It may be workable in practice, but imposes fairly high computational costs on the prover, and somewhat high gas costs on chain. Use of Town Crier is also a possibility, but requires the use of TEEs, which does not suit all users’ trust models. A helpful concept in which to frame solutions to the general problem of signing com- bined data from sources is a cryptographic tool known as functional signatures [59, 132]. Briefly, functional signatures allow a signer to delegate signing capability, such that the delegatee can only sign messages in the range of a function F chosen by the signer. We show in Appendix D how this functional constraint can serve to bound the range of report values emitted by a DON as a function of the values signed by data sources. We also introduce a new primitive, called a discretized functional signature, that in- cludes a relaxed requirement for accuracy, but is potentially much more performant than approaches such as SNARKs. The problem of combining data sources in a way that includes source authentication of outputs also applies to data aggregators, e.g., CoinCap, CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, CryptoCompare, etc., which obtain data from a multiplicity of exchanges, which they weight based on volumes, using methodologies that they in some cases make public and are in other cases proprietary. An aggregator that wishes to publish a value with source authentication faces the same challenge as a collection of nodes aggregating source data. 7.1.4 Processing Source Data Sophisticated smart contracts are likely to depend on custom aggregate statistics over primary data sources, such as volatility in recent price history over many assets, or text and photographs from news about pertinent events. Because computation and bandwidth are relatively cheap in a DON, these statistics- even complex machine-learning models with many inputs-can be processed economi- cally, as long as any output value destined for a blockchain is sufficiently concise. For computationally intensive jobs where DON participants may have differing views on complex inputs, extra rounds of communication between the DON partici- pants may be required to establish consensus on the inputs before computing the result. As long as the final value is fully determined by the inputs, once input consensus is es- tablished each participant can simply compute the value and broadcast it to the other participants with their partial signature, or send it to an aggregator. 7.2 DON Trust Minimization We envision two main ways of minimizing the trust placed in components of the DON: failover clients and minority reports. 7.2.1 Failover Clients Adversarial models in the cryptography and distributed systems literature typically consider an adversary capable of'},\n",

It is commonly observed, however, that if all nodes run identical software, an adversary that identifies a fatal exploit could in principle compromise all nodes more or less simultaneously. This setting is often referred to as a software monoculture [47]. Various proposals for automatically diversifying software and software configura- tions have been put forth to address the problem, e.g., [47, 113]. As noted in [47], however, software diversity is a complex issue and requires careful consideration. Soft- ware diversification, for example, can result in worse security than a monoculture if it increases a system’s attack surface and thus its possible vectors of attack in excess of the security benefits it offers. We believe that support for robust failover clients-i.e., clients to which nodes can switch in the face of a catastrophic event-is an especially attractive form of software diversification. Failover clients do not increase the number of potential vectors of attack, as they are not deployed as mainline software. They offer clear benefits, however, as a second line of defense. We intend to support failover clients in DONs as a key means of reducing their dependence for security on a single client. Chainlink already has in place a robust system of failover clients. Our approach involves maintaining previous, battle-tested client versions. Today, for example, Chain- link nodes with Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) as their primary client include support for Chainlink’s previous FluxMonitor system if needed. Having been in use for some time, FluxMonitor has received security audits and field testing. It provides the same functionality as OCR, just at higher cost-a cost only incurred on an as-needed basis. 7.2.2 Minority Reports Given a sufficiently large minority set Ominority-a fraction of honest nodes that ob- serve malfeasance by the majority-it can be helpful for them to generate a minority report. This is a parallel report or flag, relayed to a dependent contract SC on-chain by Ominority. SC can make use of this flag according to its own contract-specific policy. For example, for a contract in which safety is more important than liveness or respon- siveness, a minority report might cause the contract to request supplementary reports from another DON, or trigger a circuit breaker (see the next section). Minority reports can play an important role even when the majority is honest, because any report-aggregation scheme, even if it uses functional signatures, must operate in a threshold manner, to ensure resilience against oracle or data failure. In other words, it must be possible to produce a valid report based on the inputs of kS < nS oracles, for some threshold kS. This means a corrupted DON has some latitude in manipulating report values by selecting its preferred kS values among the nS reported in V by the full set of oracles, even if all sources are honest. For example, suppose that nS = 10 and kS = 7 in a system that uses a functional signature to authenticate'},\n",

For example, suppose that nS = 10 and kS = 7 in a system that uses a functional signature to authenticate computation of median over V for the USD price of ETH. Suppose that five sources report a price of $500, while the other five report $1000. Then by medianizing the lowest 7 reports, the DON can output a valid value v = $500, and by medianizing the highest, it can output v = $1000. By enhancing the DON protocol so that all nodes are aware of which data was available, and which data was used to construct a report, nodes could detect and flag statistically significant tendencies to favor one set of reports over another, and produce a minority report as a result. 7.3 Guard Rails Our trust model for DONs treats MAINCHAIN as a higher-security, higher-privilege system than DONs. (While this trust model may not always hold true, it is easier to adapt the resulting mechanism to situations where the DON is the higher security platform than vice versa.) A natural trust minimization strategy thus involves the implementation of moni- toring and failsafe mechanisms in smart contracts-either in a MAINCHAIN front end for a DON or directly in a dependent contract SC. We refer to these mechanisms as guard rails, and enumerate some of the most important here: • Circuit breakers: SC may pause or halt state updates as a function either of char- acteristics of the state updates themselves (e.g., large variance across sequential reports) or based on other inputs. For example, a circuit breaker might trip in cases where oracle reports vary implausibly over time. A circuit breaker might also be tripped by a minority report. Thus, circuit breakers can prevent DONs from making grossly erroneous reports. Circuit breakers can provide time for additional interventions to be considered or exercised. One such intervention is escape hatches. • Escape hatches: Under adverse circumstances, as identified by a set of custodi- ans, community token holders, or other bodies of trustees, a contract may invoke an emergency facility sometimes called an escape hatch [163]. An escape hatch causes SC to shut down in some manner and/or terminates pending and possibly future transactions. For example, it may return custodied funds to users [17]), may terminate contract terms [162], or may cancel pending and/or future trans- actions [173]. Escape hatches can be deployed in any type of contract, not just one that relies on a DON, but they are of interest as a potential buffer against DON malfeasance. • Failover: In systems where SC relies on the DON for essential services, it is pos- sible for SC to provide failover mechanisms that ensure service continuation even in the case of DON failure or misbehavior. For example, in the TEF (Section 6), the anchor contract SCa may provide dual interfaces where both on-chain and off-chain execution interfaces are supported for certain critical operations (e.g., withdrawal), or for ordinary transactions, with a suitable delay to prevent front- running of DON transactions. In cases where data sources sign data, users could also furnish reports to SCa when the DON fails to do so. Fraud proofs,'},\n",

Fraud proofs, as proposed for various forms of optimistic rollup (see Section 6.3), are similar in flavor and complementary to the mechanisms we enumerate above. They too provide a form of on-chain monitoring and protection against potential failures in off-chain system components. 7.4 Trust-Minimized Governance Like all decentralized systems, the Chainlink network requires governance mechanisms to adjust parameters over time, respond to emergencies, and guide its evolution. Some of these mechanisms currently reside on MAINCHAIN, and may continue to do so even with the deployment of DONs. One example is the payment mechanism for oracle node providers (DON nodes). DON front end contracts on MAINCHAIN contain additional mechanisms, such as guard rails, that may be subject to periodic modification. We foresee two classes of governance mechanisms: evolutionary and emergency. Evolutionary governance: Many modifications to the Chainlink ecosystem are such that their implementation is not a matter of urgency: Performance improvements, feature enhancements, (non-urgent) security upgrades, and so forth. As Chainlink pro- gressively moves toward even more participants in its governance, we expect many or most such changes to be ratified by the community of a specific DON affected by those changes. In the interim, and perhaps ultimately as a parallel mechanism, we believe that a notion of temporal least privilege can be a useful means of implementing evolu- tionary governance. Very simply, the idea is for changes to deploy gradually, ensuring the community an opportunity to respond to them. For example, migration to a new MAINCHAIN contract can be constrained so that the new contract must be deployed at least thirty days before activation. Emergency governance: Exploitable or exploited vulnerabilities in MAINCHAIN contracts or other forms of liveness or safety failures may require immediate interven- tion to ensure against catastrophic outcomes. Our intention is to support a multisig intervention mechanism in which, to ensure against malfeasance by any organization, signers will be dispersed across organizations. Ensuring consistent availability of signers and timely access to appropriate chains of command for authorization of emergency changes will clearly require careful operational planning and regular review. These challenges are similar to those involved in testing other cybersecurity incident-response capabilities [134], with a similar need to combat common problems like vigilance decre- ment [223]. The governance of DONs differs from that of many decentralized systems in its potential degree of heterogeneity. Each DON may have distinct data sources, executa- bles, service-level requirements such as uptime, and users. The Chainlink network’s governance mechanisms must be flexible enough to accommodate such variations in operational goals and parameters. We are actively exploring design ideas and plan to publish research on this topic in the future. 7.5 Public-Key Infrastructure With progressive decentralization will come the need for a robust identification of network participants, including DON nodes. In particular, Chainlink requires a strong Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI). A PKI is a system that binds keys to identities.

For example, a PKI undergirds the Internet’s system of secure connections (TLS): When you connect to a website via HTTPS (e.g., https://www.chainlinklabs.com) and a lock appears in your browser, that means that the public key of the domain owner has been bound to that owner by an authority-specifically, through a digital signature in a so-called certificate. A hierarchical system of certificate authorities (CAs), whose top- level root authorities are hardwired into popular browsers, helps ensure that certificates are issued only to the legitimate owners of domains. We expect that Chainlink will eventually make use of decentralized name services, initially the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) [22], as the foundation for our PKI. As its name suggests, ENS is analogous to DNS, the Domain Name System that maps (human-readable) domain names to IP addresses on the internet. ENS, however, in- stead maps human-readable Ethereum names to blockchain addresses. Because ENS operates on the Ethereum blockchain, barring key compromise, tampering with its namespace is in principle as difficult as tampering with the contract administering it and/or the underlying blockchain. (DNS, in contrast, has historically been vulnerable to spoofing, hijacking, and other attacks.) We have registered data.eth with ENS on the Ethereum mainnet, and intend to establish it as a root namespace under which the identities of oracle data services and other Chainlink network entities reside. Domains in ENS are hierarchical, meaning that each domain may contain references to other names under it. Subdomains in ENS can serve as a way to organize and delegate trust. The main role of data.eth will be to serve as an on-chain directory service for data feeds. Traditionally, developers and users of oracles have used off-chain sources (e.g., websites like docs.chain.link or data.chain.link, or social networks such as Twitter) to publish and obtain oracle data feed addresses (such as the ETH-USD price feed). With a highly trustworthy root namespace such as data.eth, it is possible in- stead to establish a mapping of eth-usd.data.eth to, e.g., the smart contract address of an on-chain oracle network aggregator for the ETH-USD price feed. This would create a secure path for anyone to refer to the blockchain as the source of truth for that data feed of that price/name pair (ETH-USD). Consequently, such use of ENS realizes two benefits unavailable in off-chain data sources: • Strong security: All changes and updates to the domain are recorded immutably and secured cryptographically, as opposed to text addresses on a website, which enjoy neither of these two security properties. • Automated on-chain propagation: Updates to the underlying address of a data- feed’s smart contract can trigger notifications that propagate to dependent smart contracts and can, for example, automatically update dependent contracts with the new addresses.13 Namespaces like ENS, however, do not automatically validate legitimate ownership of asserted names. Thus, for example, if the namespace includes the entry ⟨“Acme Oracle Node Co.”, addr⟩, then a user obtains the assurance that addr belongs to the claimant of the name Acme Oracle Node Co. Without additional mechanisms around namespace administration, however, she does not obtain assurance that the name belongs to an entity legitimately called Acme Oracle Node Co. in a meaningful real world'},\n",

Our approach to validation of names, i.e., ensuring their ownership by correspond- ing, legitimate real-world entities, relies on several components. Today, Chainlink Labs effectively acts as a CA for the Chainlink network. While Chainlink Labs will continue to validate names, our PKI will evolve into a more decentralized model in two ways: • Web-of-trust model: The decentralized counterpart of a hierarchical PKI is of- ten referred to as a web-of-trust.14 Variants have been proposed since the 1990s, e.g., [98], and a number of researchers have observed that blockchains can facil- itate use of the idea, e.g., [227] by recording certificates in a globally consistent ledger. We are exploring variants of this model to validate the identities of entities in the Chainlink network in a more decentralized way. 13A dependent contract can optionally include a predetermined delay to allow for manual inspection and intervention by dependent-contract administrators. 14A term coined by Phil Zimmermann for PGP [238]. • Linkage to validating data: Today, a substantial amount of oracle node perfor- mance data is visible on-chain, and thus archivally bound to node addresses. Such data may be viewed as enriching an identity in the PKI by providing his- torical evidence of its (reliable) participation in the network. Additionally, tools for decentralized identity based on DECO and Town Crier [160] enable nodes to accumulate credentials derived from real-world data. As just one example, a node operator can attach a credential to its PKI identity that proves possession of a Dun and Bradstreet rating. These supplementary forms of validation can supplement staking in creating assurance of the security of the network. An or- acle node with an established real-world identity may be viewed as having stake in a system deriving from its reputation. (See Section 4.3 and Section 9.6.3.) A final requirement for the Chainlink PKI is secure bootstrapping, i.e., securely publishing the root name for the Chainlink network, currently data.eth (analogously to hardwiring of top-level domains in browsers). In other words, how do Chainlink users determine that data.eth is indeed the top-level domain associated with the Chainlink project? The solution to this problem for the Chainlink network is multi-pronged and may involve: • Adding a TXT record [224] to our domain record for chain.link that specifies data.eth as the root domain for the Chainlink ecosystem. (Chainlink thus im- plicitly leverages the PKI for internet domains to validate its root ENS domain.) • Linking to data.eth from Chainlink’s existing website, e.g., from https://docs.chain.link. (Another implicit use of the PKI for internet do- mains.) • Making the use of data.eth known via various documents, including this whitepa- per. • Posting data.eth publicly on our social-media channels, such as Twitter, and the Chainlink blog [18]. • Placing a large quantity of LINK under the control of the same registrant address as data.eth.

DON Deployment Considerations While not a part of our core design, there are several important technical considerations in the realization of DONs that deserve treatment here. 8.1 Rollout Approach This paper lays out an ambitious vision of advanced Chainlink functionality whose realization will require solutions to many challenges along the way. This whitepaper identifies some challenges, but unanticipated ones are sure to arise. We plan to implement elements of this vision in an incremental fashion over an extended period of time. Our expectation is that DONs will initially launch with support for specific pre-built components built collaboratively by teams within the Chainlink community. The intention is that broader uses of DONs, e.g., the ability to launch arbitrary executables, will see support at a later time. One reason for such caution is that composition of smart contracts can have com- plex, unintended, and dangerous side effects, as recent flash-loan-based attacks have for instance shown [127, 189]. Similarly, composition of smart contracts, adapters, and executables will require extreme care. In our initial deployment of DONs, we plan to include only a pre-built set of tem- platized executables and adapters. This will enable study of the compositional security of these functionalities using formal methods [46, 170] and other approaches. It will also simplify pricing: Functionality pricing can be established by DON nodes on a per- functionality basis, rather than through generalized metering, an approach adopted in, e.g., [156]. We also expect the Chainlink community to take part in the creation of additional templates, combining various adapters and executables into increasingly useful decentralized services that can be run by hundreds, if not thousands of individual DONs. Additionally, this approach can help prevent state bloat, i.e., the need for DON nodes to retain an unworkable amount of state in working memory. This problem is already arising in permissionless blockchains, motivating approaches such as “stateless clients” (see, e.g., [206]). It can be more acute in higher throughput systems, motivating an approach in which a DON deploys only state-size-optimized executables. As DONs evolve and mature and include robust guard rails, as discussed in Sec- tion 7, cryptoeconomic and reputation-based security mechanisms as discussed in Sec- tion 9, and other features that provide a high degree of assurance for DON users, we also expect to develop a framework and tools to facilitate broader launch and use of DONs by the community. Ideally, these tools will enable a collection of node operators to come together as an oracle network and launch their own DONs in a permissionless or self-service manner, meaning that they can do so unilaterally. 8.2 Dynamic DON Membership The set of nodes running a given DON may change over time. There are two approaches to key management for skL given dynamic membership in O. The first is to update shares of skL held by the nodes upon changes in membership, while keeping pkL unchanged. This approach, explored in [41, 161, 198], has the merit of not requiring that relying parties update pkL. The classical technique of share resharing, introduced in [122], provides a simple and efficient way of realizing such share updates. It enables a secret to be transferred between one set of nodes O(1) and a second, possibly intersecting'},\n",

It enables a secret to be transferred between one set of nodes O(1) and a second, possibly intersecting one O(2). In this approach, each node O(1) i performs a (k(2), n(2)) secret sharing of its secret share across nodes in O(2) for n(2) = |O(2)| and desired (possibly new) threshold k(2). Various verifi- able secret sharing (VSS) schemes [108] can provide security against an adversary that actively corrupts nodes, i.e., introduces malicious behavior into the protocol. Tech- niques in [161] aim to do so while reducing communication complexity and providing resilience against failures in cryptographic hardness assumptions. A second approach is to update the ledger key pkL. This has the benefit of forward security: Compromise of old shares of pkL (i.e., former committee nodes) would not result in compromise of the current key. Updates to pkL, however, carry two drawbacks: (1) Data encrypted under pkL needs to be re-encrypted during a key refresh and (2) Key updates need to be propagated to relying parties. We intend to explore both approaches, as well as hybridizations of the two. 8.3 DON Accountability As with existing Chainlink oracle networks, DONs will include mechanisms for account- ability, i.e., recording, monitoring, and enforcing correct node behavior. DONs will have much more substantial data capacity than many existing permissionless blockchains, particularly given their ability to connect to external decentralized storage. Conse- quently, they will be able to record nodes’ performance history in detail, allowing for more fine-grained accountability mechanisms. For example, off-chain computation of asset prices may involve inputs that are discarded before a median result is sent on chain. In a DON, these intermediate results could be recorded. Misbehavior or per- formance lapses by individual nodes in a DON can thus be remedied or penalized on the DON in a fine-grained way. We have additionally discussed approaches to building guard rails in Section 7.3 that address the contract-specific impact of systemic failures. It is also important, however, to have failsafe mechanisms for DONs themselves, i.e., protections against systemic, potentially catastrophic DON failures, specifically forking / equivocation and service-level agreement (SLA) failures, as we now explain. Forking / equivocation: Given sufficiently many faulty nodes, a DON can fork or equivocate, producing two distinct, inconsistent blocks or sequences of blocks in L. Because a DON digitally signs the contents of L, however, it is possible to leverage a main chain MAINCHAIN to prevent and/or penalize equivocation. The DON can periodically checkpoint state from L in an audit contract on MAINCHAIN. If its future state deviates from a checkpointed state, a user / auditor can present proof of this misbehavior to the audit contract. Such proof can be used to generate an alert or penalize DON nodes via slashing in the contract. This latter approach introduces an incentive design problem similar to that for specific oracle feeds, and can build on our work outlined in Section 9. Enforcing service-level agreements: While DONs are not necessarily meant to run indefinitely, it is important that they adhere to service level agreements (SLAs) with their users. Basic SLA enforcement is possible on a main chain. For example, DON nodes'},\n",

Enforcing service-level agreements: While DONs are not necessarily meant to run indefinitely, it is important that they adhere to service level agreements (SLAs) with their users. Basic SLA enforcement is possible on a main chain. For example, DON nodes might commit to maintaining the DON until a certain date, or to provid- ing advance notice of service termination (e.g., three months’ notice). A contract on MAINCHAIN can provide basic cryptoeconomic SLA enforcement. For example, the SLA contract can slash DON-deposited funds if checkpoints are not provided at required intervals. A user can deposit funds and challenge the DON to prove that a checkpoint correctly represents a sequence of valid blocks (in a manner analogous to, e.g. [141]). Of course, block production does not equate with transaction processing, but the SLA contract can also serve to enforce the latter. For example, in the legacy-compatible version of FSS in which transactions are fetched from the mem- pool (see Section 5.2), transactions are eventually mined and placed on chain. A user can prove DON malfeasance by furnishing the SLA contract with a transaction that was mined but wasn’t transmitted by the DON for processing by the target contract within the appropriate interval of time.15 It is also possible to prove the existence of and penalize more fine-grained SLA failures, including errors in computation using executables (via, e.g., the mechanisms for proving correct off-chain state transactions outlined in Section 6.3) or failure to run executables based on initiators visible on a DON, failure to relay data on the DON to MAINCHAIN in a timely way, and so forth. Economics and Cryptoeconomics For the Chainlink network to achieve strong security within a decentralized trust model, it is essential that nodes collectively exhibit correct behavior, meaning that they adhere a majority of the time exactly to DON protocols. In this section, we discuss approaches to helping enforce such behavior by means of economic incentives, a.k.a. cryptoeconomic incentives. These incentives fall into two categories: explicit and implicit, realized respectively through staking and future fee opportunity (FFO). Staking: Staking in Chainlink, as in other blockchain systems, involves network par- ticipants, i.e., oracle nodes, depositing locked funds in the form of LINK tokens. These funds, which we also refer to as stake or explicit stake are an explicit incentive. They are subject to forfeiture upon node failure or malfeasance. In the blockchain context, this procedure is often called slashing. Staking by oracle nodes in Chainlink, however, differs fundamentally from staking by validators in permissionless blockchains. Validators can misbehave by equivocat- ing or adversarially ordering transactions. The underlying consensus protocol in a 15As users can replace transactions in the mempool, care is required to ensure a correct correspon- dence between the mined and DON-submitted transactions. permissionless blockchain, though, uses hard-and-fast block-validation rules and cryp- tographic primitives to prevent validators from generating invalid blocks. In contrast, programmatic protections cannot prevent a cheating oracle network from generating invalid reports. The reason is a key difference between the two types of system: transac- tion validation in blockchains is a property of internal consistency, while the correctness of oracle reports on a blockchain is a property of external, i.e., off-chain data.

We have designed a preliminary staking mechanism for the Chainlink network based on an interactive protocol among oracle nodes that may make use of external data. This mechanism creates financial incentives for correct behavior using explicit rewards and penalties (slashing). As the mechanism is economic, it is designed to prevent node corruption by an adversary that uses financial resources to corrupt nodes by means of bribery. (Such an adversary is very general, and extends, e.g., to nodes cooperating to extract value from their collective misbehavior.) The Chainlink staking mechanism we have designed has some powerful and novel features.16 The main such feature is super-linear staking impact (specifically, quadratic). An adversary must have resources considerably in excess of nodes’ deposited funds in order to subvert the mechanism. Our staking mechanism additionally provides protec- tion against a stronger adversary than previously considered in similar systems, namely an adversary that can create bribes conditioning on nodes’ future behavior. Addition- ally, we discuss how Chainlink tools such as DECO can help strengthen our staking mechanism by facilitating correct adjudication in the case of faulty node behavior. Future fee opportunity (FFO): Permissionless blockchains-of both the PoW and PoS variety-today rely critically on what we call implicit incentives. These are economic incentives for honest behavior that derive not from explicit rewards, but from platform participation itself. For example, the Bitcoin miner community is in- centivized against mounting a 51% attack by the risk of undermining confidence in Bitcoin, depressing its value, and consequently eroding the value of their collective capital investments in mining infrastructure [150]. The Chainlink network benefits from a similar implicit incentive that we refer to as future fee opportunity (FFO). Oracle nodes with strong performance histories or reputations attract fees from users. Misbehavior by an oracle node jeopardizes future fee payments and thus penalizes the node with an opportunity cost in terms of potential revenue earned through participation in the network. By analogy with explicit stake, FFO may be viewed as a form of implicit stake, an incentive for honest behavior that derives from the shared benefit of maintaining confidence in the platform on which node operators’ business depends, i.e., the positive performance and reputation of the network. This incentive is inherent in but not explicitly expressed in Chainlink network protocols. In Bitcoin, maintaining the value of mining operations as mentioned above 16The staking mechanism we describe here currently aims only to enforce delivery of correct reports by oracle networks. We expect in future work to extend it to ensure correct execution of the many other functionalities DONs will provide. may similarly be viewed as a form of implicit stake. We emphasize that FFO already exists in Chainlink and helps secure the network today. Our main contribution in the further development of Chainlink will be a princi- pled, empirically driven approach to evaluating implicit incentives such as FFO through what we call the Implicit-Incentive Framework (IIF). To estimate quantities such as the future fee opportunity of nodes, the IIF will draw continuously on the comprehensive performance and payment data amassed by the Chainlink network. Such'},\n",

To estimate quantities such as the future fee opportunity of nodes, the IIF will draw continuously on the comprehensive performance and payment data amassed by the Chainlink network. Such estimates will enable IIF-based parameterization of staking systems that reflects node incentives with greater accuracy than current heuristic and/or static models. To summarize, then, the two main economic incentives for correct oracle node behavior in the developing Chainlink network will be: • Staking (deposited stake) o Explicit incentive • Future fee opportunity (FFO) o Implicit incentive These two forms of incentive are complementary. Oracle nodes can simultaneously participate in the Chainlink staking protocol, enjoy an ongoing revenue stream from users, and collectively benefit from their continued good behavior. Thus both incentives contribute to the cryptoeconomic security provided by an oracle network. Additionally, the two incentives can reinforce and/or be traded offagainst one another. For example, a new oracle operator without a performance history and revenue stream can stake a large quantity of LINK as a guarantee of honest behavior, thereby attracting users and fees. Conversely, an established oracle operator with a long, relatively fault-free performance history can charge substantial fees from a large user base and thus rely more heavily on its FFO as a form of implicit incentive. In general, the approach we consider here aims for a given amount of oracle-network resource to create the greatest possible economic incentives in Chainlink for rational agents-i.e., nodes maximizing their financial utility-to behave honestly. Put another way, the goal is to maximize the financial resources required for an adversary to attack the network successfully. By formulating a staking protocol with mathematically well defined economic security and also using the IIF, we aim to measure the strength of Chainlink’s incentives as accurately as possible. The creators of relying contracts will then be able to determine with strong confidence whether an oracle network meets their required levels of cryptoeconomic security. The virtuous cycle of economic security: The incentives we discuss in this sec- tion, staking and FFO, have an impact beyond their reinforcement of the security of DONs. They promise to induce what we call a virtuous cycle of economic security. Super-linear staking impact (and other economies of scale) result in lower operational cost as a DON’s security grows. Lower cost attracts additional users to the DON, boosting fee payments. A rise in fee payments continues to incentivize growth of the network, which perpetuates the virtuous cycle. We believe that the virtuous cycle of economic security is just one example of an economy of scale and network effect among others that we discuss later in this section.

Finally, we briefly describe other potential effects propelling growth of the Chainlink network in Section 9.9. 9.1 Staking Overview The staking mechanism design we introduce here, as noted above, involves an inter- active protocol among oracle nodes allowing for resolution of inconsistencies in the reporting of external data. Staking aims to ensure honest behavior from rational or- acle nodes. We can therefore model an adversary attacking a staking protocol as a briber: The adversary’s strategy is to corrupt oracle nodes using financial incentives. The adversary may derive financial resources prospectively from successfully tampering with an oracle report, e.g., offer to share the resulting profit with corrupted nodes. We aim in our staking mechanism design simultaneously at two ambitious goals: 1. Resisting a powerful adversary: The staking mechanism is designed to protect oracle networks against a broad class of adversaries that are capable of complex, conditional bribing strategies, including prospective bribery, which offers bribes to oracles whose identities are determined after the fact (e.g., offers bribes to oracles randomly selected for high-priority alerting). While other oracle designs have considered a narrow set of attacks without the full capabilities of a realistic adversary, to the best of our knowledge the adversarial mechanism we introduce here is the first to explicitly address a broad set of bribing strategies and show resistance in this model. Our model assumes that nodes besides the attacker are economically rational (as opposed to honest), and we assume the existence of a source of truth that is prohibitively expensive for typical usage but is available in case of disagreement (discussed further below). 2. Achieving super-linear staking impact: Our aim is to ensure that an oracle network composed of rational agents reports truthfully even in the presence of an attacker with a budget that is super-linear in the total stake deposited by the entire network. In existing staking systems, if each of n nodes stakes $d, an attacker can issue a credible bribe which requests that nodes behave dishonestly in exchange for a payment of slightly more than $d to each node, using a total budget of about $dn. This is already a high bar as the attacker has to have a liquid budget on the order of the combined deposits of all stakers in the network. Our goal is a still stronger degree of economic security than this already substantial hurdle. We aim to design the first staking system that can achieve security for a general attacker with a budget super-linear in n. While practical considerations may achieve a lower impact, as we discuss below, our preliminary design achieves an adversarial budget requirement greater than $dn2/2, i.e., scaling quadratic in n, rendering bribery largely impractical even when nodes stake only moderate amounts. Reaching these two goals requires an innovative combination of incentive design and cryptography. Key ideas: Our staking approach hinges on an idea we call watchdog priority.

Reaching these two goals requires an innovative combination of incentive design and cryptography. Key ideas: Our staking approach hinges on an idea we call watchdog priority. A report generated by a Chainlink oracle network and sent to a relying contract (e.g., on an asset price) is aggregated from individual reports contributed by partici- pating nodes (e.g., by taking the median). Typically a service-level agreement (SLA) specifies acceptable bounds of deviation for reports, i.e., how far a node’s report can deviate from the aggregate report and how far the aggregate should be permitted to deviate from the true value to be considered correct. In our staking system, for a given reporting round, each oracle node can act as a watchdog to raise an alert if it believes the aggregate report is incorrect. In each reporting round, each oracle node is assigned a public priority that determines the order in which its alert (if any) will be processed. Our mechanism aims at reward concentration, meaning that the highest-priority watchdog to raise an alert earns the entire reward yielded by confiscating the deposits of faulty nodes. Our staking system designs involve two tiers: the first, default tier, and the second, backstop tier. The first tier is the oracle network itself, a set of n nodes. (For simplicity, we assume n is odd.) If a majority of nodes report incorrect values, a watchdog in the first tier is strongly incentivized to raise an alert. If an alert is raised, the reporting decision of the network is then escalated to a second tier-a high-cost, maximum- reliability system that can be user-specified in the network service-level agreement. This could be a system which, for example, is composed only of nodes with strong historical reliability scores, or one that has an order of magnitude more oracles than the first tier. Additionally, as discussed in Section 9.4.3, DECO or Town Crier can serve as powerful tools to help ensure efficient and conclusive adjudication in the second tier. For simplicity we thus assume that this second-tier system arrives at a correct report value. While it might seem attractive just to rely on the second tier to generate all reports, the benefit of our design is that it consistently achieves the security properties of the second-tier system while only paying the operating cost, in the typical case, of the first-tier system. Watchdog priority results in super-linear staking impact in the following way: if the first-tier oracle network outputs an incorrect result and a number of watchdog nodes alert, the staking incentive mechanism rewards the highest-priority watchdog with more than $dn/2 drawn from the deposits of the (majority) misbehaving nodes. The total reward is thus concentrated in the hands of this single watchdog, which therefore determines the minimum that an adversary must promise a potential watchdog to incentivize it not to alert. Since our mechanism ensures that every oracle gets the chance to act as watchdog if the higher-priority watchdogs have accepted their bribes (and chosen not to alert), the adversary must therefore offer a bribe of more than $dn/2 to every node to prevent any alert being raised. Since there are n nodes, the adversary’s requisite budget for a successful bribe amounts to more than $dn2/2, which is quadratic in the number n of nodes in the'},\n",

Game theory is the mathematically formalized study of strategic interaction. In this context, a game is a model of such an interaction, typically in the real world, that codifies sets of actions available to participants in the game, known as players. A game also specifies the payoffs obtained by the individual players-rewards that depend on a player’s chosen actions and the actions of the other players. Perhaps the best known example of a game studied in game theory is the Prisoners’ Dilemma [178]. Game theorists generally aim to understand the equilibrium or equilibria (if any) represented in a given game. An equilibrium is a set of strategies (one for each player) such that no one player can obtain a higher payoffby unilaterally deviating from its strategy. Mechanism design, meanwhile, is the science of designing incentives such that the equilibrium of an interaction (and its associated game) has some desirable property. MD may be viewed as the inverse of game theory: The canonical question in game theory is, “given the incentives and model, what will the equilibrium be?” In MD, the question is instead, “what incentives will result in a game with a desirable equilibrium?” A typical goal of a mechanism designer is to create an ‘incentive compatible’ mecha- nism, meaning that participants in the mechanism (e.g., an auction or other information elicitation system [228]) are incentivized to report the truth on some matter (e.g., how much they value a particular item). The Vickrey (second-price) auction is perhaps the best known incentive compatible mechanism, in which participants submit sealed bids for an item and the highest bidder wins the item but pays the second-highest price [214]. Cryptoeconomics is a domain-specific form of MD that leverages cryptographic techniques to create desirable equilibria within decentralized systems. Bribery and collusion create significant challenges throughout the field of MD. Al- most all mechanisms break in the presence of collusion, defined as side contracts be- tween the parties participating in a mechanism [125, 130]. Bribery, in which an exter- nal party introduces novel incentives into the game, presents an even tougher problem than does collusion; collusion may be viewed as a special case of bribery among game participants. Blockchain systems can often be conceptualized as games with monetary (cryptocurrency- based) payoffs. A simple example is Proof-of-Work mining: miners have an action space in which they can choose the hashrate with which to mine for blocks. The payoffof min- ing is a guaranteed negative reward (cost of electricity and equipment) plus a stochastic positive reward (mining subsidy) that depends on the number of other active miners [106, 172] and transaction fees. Crowdsourced oracles like SchellingCoin [68] are an- other example: the action space is the set of possible reports an oracle may send, while the payoffis the reward specified by the oracle mechanism, e.g., payment might depend on how close an'},\n",

Blockchain games offer ripe opportunities for collusion and bribery attacks; indeed, smart contracts can even facilitate such attacks [96, 165]. Perhaps the best known bribery attack on crowdsourced oracles is the p-plus-epsilon attack [67]. This attack arises in the context of a SchellingCoin-like mechanism in which players submit boolean- valued reports (i.e., false or true) and are rewarded with p if they agree with the majority submission. In a p-plus-epsilon attack, the attacker credibly promises to, e.g., pay users $p + ϵ for voting false if and only if the majority submission is true. The result is an equilibrium, in which all players are incentivized to report false irrespective of what other players do; consequently, the briber can induce the nodes through its promised bribe to report false without actually paying the bribe (!). Exploration of other briber strategies in the context of oracles, however-and par- ticularly oracles that are not crowdsourced-has been limited to fairly weak adversarial models. For example, in the PoW setting, researchers have studied outcome-contingent bribes, i.e., bribes paid only if a target message is successfully censored and does not appear in a block, irrespective of an individual miner’s action [96, 165]. In the case of oracles, however, other than the p-plus-epsilon attack, we are aware only of work in a strictly limited model of bribery in which a briber sends a bribe conditioned on an individual player’s action, not on the resulting outcome. Here we sketch designs of information-elicitation mechanisms that remain incentive compatible even in a strong adversarial model, as described in the next subsection. 9.3 Modeling Assumptions In this subsection, we explain how we model the behavior and capabilities of players in our system, specifically first-tier oracle nodes, nodes in the second-tier (adjudication) layer, and adversaries. 9.3.1 First-Tier Incentive Model: Rational Actors Many blockchain systems rely for security on the assumption of some number of honest participating nodes. Nodes are defined to be honest if they follow the protocol even when it is not in their financial interest to do so. Proof-of-Work systems typically require the majority of hash power to be honest, Proof-of-Stake systems typically re- quire 2/3 or more of all participating stake to be honest, and even layer-2 systems like Arbitrum [141] require at least a single honest participant. In modeling for our staking mechanism, we make a much weaker assumption. (To be clear, weaker assumptions mean stronger security properties and are therefore prefer- able.) We assume that the adversary has corrupted, i.e., controls, some (minority) fraction of first-tier oracle nodes. We model the remaining nodes not as honest agents, but as rational expected-utility maximizers. These nodes act entirely according to self- interested financial incentives, choosing actions that result in an expected financial gain. For example, if a node is offered a bribe larger than the reward resulting from honest behavior, it will accept the bribe. Note on adversarial nodes: In accordance with the trust modeling'},\n",

Note on adversarial nodes: In accordance with the trust modeling common for decentralized systems, we assume that all nodes are rational, i.e., seeking to maximize net revenue, rather than controlled by a malicious adversary. Our claims, however- specifically super-linear or quadratic staking impact-hold asymptotically provided that the set of adversarially controlled nodes is at most (1/2 −c)n, for some positive constant c. 9.3.2 Second-Tier Adjudication Model: Correctness by Assumption Recall that a critical feature of our staking mechanism that helps achieve security against rational nodes is its second-tier system. In our proposed staking mechanism, any oracle may raise an alert indicating that it believes the output of the mechanism is incorrect. An alert results in a high-trust second-tier system activating and reporting the correct result. Thus, a key modeling requirement for our approach is correct adjudication, i.e., correct reporting by the second-tier system. Our staking model assumes a second-tier system that acts as an incorruptible, maxi- mally reliable source of truth. Such a system is likely to be expensive and slow, and thus inappropriate for use for the typical case. In the equilibrium case, however, i.e., when the first-tier system functions correctly, the second-tier system will not be invoked. Instead, its existence boosts the security of the whole oracle system by providing a high-assurance backstop. The use of a high-trust, high-cost adjudication layer resembles the appeals process at the heart of most judicial systems. It is also already common in the design of oracle systems, e.g., [119, 185]. We briefly discuss approaches to realization of the second tier in our mechanism in Section 9.4.3. Our staking protocol uses the assumed correct adjudication of the second-tier sys- tem as a credible threat to enforce correct reporting by oracle nodes. The protocol confiscates part or all of the stake of oracle nodes that generate reports identified by the second-tier system as incorrect. Oracle nodes are thus deterred from misbehaving by the resulting financial penalty. This approach is similar in flavor to that used in optimistic rollups, e.g., [141, 10]. 9.3.3 Adversarial Model Our staking mechanism is designed to elicit truthful information while achieving secu- rity against a broad, well-defined class of adversaries. It improves upon prior works, which either omit an explicit adversarial model or focus on narrow sub-classes of adver- saries, e.g., the p-plus-epsilon adversary discussed above. Our goal is to design a staking mechanism with formally proven security against the full spectrum of adversaries likely to be encountered in practice. We model our adversary as having a fixed (parameterizable) budget, denoted by $B. The adversary can communicate individually and confidentially with each oracle in the network, and can secretly offer any individual oracle guaranteed payment of a bribe contingent on publicly observable outcomes of the mechanism. Outcomes determining bribes can include, for example, the value reported by the oracle, any public messages sent by any oracle to the mechanism (e.g., an alert), the values reported by other oracles, and the value output by the mechanism. No mechanism can secure against an attacker with unlimited capabilities. We there- fore consider some'},\n",

No mechanism can secure against an attacker with unlimited capabilities. We there- fore consider some behaviors as unrealistic or out-of-scope. We assume our attacker cannot break standard cryptographic primitives, and, as noted above, has a fixed (if potentially large) budget $B. We further assume that the adversary does not control communication in the oracle network, specifically that it cannot substantially delay traffic between first-tier and/or second-tier nodes. (Whether the adversary can ob- serve such communication depends on the particular mechanism, as we explain below.) Informally, however, as noted above, we assume that the adversary can: (1) Corrupt a fraction of oracle nodes ((1/2 −c)-fraction for some constant c), i.e., fully control them, and (2) Offer bribes to any desired nodes, with guaranteed payment contingent on outcomes specified by the adversary, as described above. While we don’t offer a formal model or complete taxonomy of the adversary’s full range of bribing capabilities in this whitepaper, here are examples of the kinds of bribers encompassed by our model. For simplicity, we assume that oracles emit Boolean reports whose correct value (w.l.o.g.) is true, and that a final outcome is computed as an aggregate of these reports to be used by a consuming smart contract. The briber’s aim is for the final outcome to be incorrect, i.e., false. • Unconditional briber: Briber offers bribe $b to any oracle that reports false. • Probabilistic briber: Briber offers bribe $b with some probability q to any oracle that reports false. • false-outcome conditioned briber: Briber offers bribe $b to any oracle that re- ports false provided that the final outcome is false. • No-alert-conditioned briber: Briber offers bribe $b to any oracle that reports false as long as no alert is raised. • p-plus-epsilon Briber: Briber offers bribe $b to any oracle that reports false as long as the majority of oracles do not report false. • Prospective briber: Briber offers bribe $b in advance to whichever oracle is selected for a randomized role and reports false. In our proposed staking protocol, all nodes act as potential watchdogs, and we are able to show that randomization of watchdog priorities does not lend itself to prospective bribery. Many proof- of-work, proof-of-stake, and permissioned systems are susceptible to prospective bribery, however, which shows the importance of considering it in our adversarial model and ensuring that our staking protocols are resilient to it. See Appendix E for more details. 9.3.4 How Much Cryptoeconomic Security Is Enough? A rational adversary will only spend money to attack a system if it can obtain a profit larger than its expenditure. Thus for our adversarial model and proposed staking mechanism, $B may be viewed as a measure of the potential profit an adversary is able to extract from relying smart contracts by corrupting an oracle network and causing it to generate an incorrect report or set of reports. In deciding whether an oracle network offers a sufficient degree of cryptoeconomic security for their purposes, a user should assess the network from this perspective.

For plausible adversaries in practical settings, we expect that $B will generally be substantially smaller than the total assets in relying smart contracts. In most cases, it is infeasible for an adversary to extract these assets in their totality. 9.4 Staking Mechanism: Sketch Here we present the main ideas and general structure of the staking mechanism we are currently considering. For ease of presentation, we describe a simple but slow (multi-round) protocol in this subsection. We note, however, that this scheme is quite practical. Given the economic assurances provided by the mechanism, i.e., the penal- ization of and consequent incentive against faulty nodes, many users may be willing to accept reports optimistically. In other words, such users may accept reports prior to potential adjudication by the second tier. Users unwilling to accept reports optimistically can choose to wait until the protocol execution terminates, i.e., until any potential escalation to the second tier occurs. This, however, can substantially slow the confirmation time for reports. We therefore briefly Figure 15: Schematic of staking scheme with alerting. In this example, 1⃝a majority of nodes are corrupted / bribed and emit an incorrect value ˜r, rather than the correct report value r. The watchdog node 2⃝sends an alert to the second-tier committee, which 3⃝determines and emits the correct report value r, resulting in corrupted nodes forfeiting their deposits-each $d to the watchdog node 4⃝. outline some optimizations that result in a faster (single-round) if somewhat more complex design in Section 9.5. Recall that the first tier in our staking mechanism consists of the basic oracle network itself. The main structure of our mechanism, as described above, is that in each round, each node can act as a “watchdog” with some priority, and it thus has the ability to raise an alert if the mechanism arrives at an incorrect output ˜r, rather than a correct one r. This alert causes second-tier resolution, which we assume arrives at a correct report. Nodes with incorrect reports are punished, in the sense that their stakes are slashed and awarded to watchdogs. This basic structure is common in oracle systems, as in, e.g., [119, 185]. The key innovation in our design, mentioned briefly above, is that every node is assigned a distinct priority in the ordering of potential watchdogs. That is, watchdogs are given opportunities to alert in priority sequence. Recall that if a node has the highest priority to raise an alert, it receives the slashed deposit $d of every misbehaving node, for a total of more than $dn/2 = $d × n/2, as an incorrect report implies a majority of bad nodes. Consequently, the adversary must pay at least this reward to bribe an arbitrary node. Thus, to bribe a majority of nodes, the adversary must pay a large bribe to a majority of nodes, namely, strictly more than $dn2/2. We show schematically how alerting and watchdog escalation works in Fig. 15. 9.4.1 Further Mechanism Details The bribery-resistant system we now describe in further detail is a simplified sketch of the two-tiered construction we intend to build.

We show schematically how alerting and watchdog escalation works in Fig. 15. 9.4.1 Further Mechanism Details The bribery-resistant system we now describe in further detail is a simplified sketch of the two-tiered construction we intend to build. Most of our focus will be on describing the first-tier network (henceforth simply “network” where clear from context) along with its incentive mechanism and the procedure for escalation to the second tier. Consider a Chainlink network composed of n oracle nodes that are responsible for regularly (e.g., once a minute) reporting a boolean value (e.g., whether the market capitalization of BTC exceeds that of ETH). As part of the staking mechanism, nodes must provide two deposits: a deposit $d subject to slashing in the event of disagreement with the majority and a watchdog deposit $dw subject to slashing in the event of a faulty escalation. We assume that the nodes cannot copy the submissions of other nodes, e.g., through a commit-reveal scheme as discussed in Section 5.3. In each round, nodes first commit to their report, and once all nodes have committed (or a timeout has expired), nodes reveal their reports. For each report to be generated, every node is also given a watchdog priority be- tween 1 and n chosen at random, with 1 being top priority. This priority enables the concentration of reward in the hands of one watchdog. After all reports are public, an alerting phase ensues. Over a sequence of n (synchronous) rounds, the node with priority i has the opportunity to alert in round i. Let us consider the possible outcomes for the mechanism after nodes have revealed their reports. Again assuming a binary report, suppose the correct value is true and the incorrect one is false. Suppose also that the first-tier mechanism outputs the majority value output by nodes as the final report r. There are three possible outcomes in the mechanism: • Complete agreement: In the best case, nodes are in complete agreement: all nodes are available and have provided a timely report of the same value r (either true or false). In this case, the network need only forward r to relying contracts and reward each node with a fixed per-round payment $p, which is much smaller than $d. • Partial agreement: It is possible that some nodes are offline or there is dis- agreement about which value is correct, but most nodes report true and only a minority reports false. This case is also straightforward. The majority value (true) is computed, resulting in a correct report r. All nodes that reported r are rewarded with $p while the oracles that reported incorrectly have their deposits slashed modestly, e.g., by $10p. • Alert: In the event that a watchdog believes the output of the network is incorrect, it publicly triggers an alert, escalating the mechanism to the second-tier network. There are then two possible results: - Correct alert: If the second-tier network confirms that the output of the Figure 16: Amplifying briber’s cost through concentrated alerting rewards. A bribing adversary must bribe each node with more than the reward it stands to gain by alerting (shown as a red bar). If alerting rewards are shared, then this reward may be relatively small.

A bribing adversary must bribe each node with more than the reward it stands to gain by alerting (shown as a red bar). If alerting rewards are shared, then this reward may be relatively small. Concentrated alerting rewards increase the reward that any single node may obtain (tall red bar). Consequently the total payout by the adversary for a viable bribe (gray regions) is much larger with concentrated than shared alerting rewards. first-tier network was incorrect, the alerting watchdog node receives a reward consisting of all slashed deposits, and thus more than $dn/2. - Faulty alert: If the second-tier and first-tier oracles agree, the escalation is deemed faulty and the alerting node loses its $dw deposit. In the case of optimistic acceptance of reports, watchdog alerts do not cause any change in execution of relying contracts. For contracts designed to await potential arbitration by the second-tier committee, watchdog alerts delay but do not freeze contract execution. It is also possible for contracts to designate a failover DON for periods of adjudication. 9.4.2 Quadratic Staking Impact The ability for every node to act as a watchdog, combined with strict node priority ensuring concentrated rewards, enables the mechanism to achieve quadratic staking impact for each kind of bribing attacker described in Section 9.3.3. Recall that this means specifically in our setting that, for a network with n nodes each with deposit $d, a successful briber (of any of the kinds above) must have a budget of bigger than $dn2/2. To be precise, the briber must corrupt at least (n+1)/2 nodes, since the briber must corrupt a majority of n nodes (for odd n, by assumption). Thus, a watchdog stands to earn a reward of $d(n + 1)/2. The briber consequently must pay this amount to every node to ensure that none acts as a watchdog. We are working to show formally that if the briber has a budget of at most $d(n2 + n)/2, then the subgame perfect equilibrium of the game between the bribers and the oracles-in other words, the equilibrium at any point during the play of the game-is for the briber not to issue the bribe and for each oracle to report its true values honestly. We have explained above how it is possible that a successful briber could require a budget significantly larger than that of the sum of the node deposits. To illustrate this intuitive result, Fig. 16 shows the impact of concentrated alert rewards graphically. As we see there, if the reward for watchdog alerting-namely the deposits of bribed nodes reporting false)-were split among all potential alerting, the total amount that any individual alerting node could expect would be relatively small, on the order of $d. A briber, knowing that a payout of larger than $d was improbable, could use a false-outcome conditional bribe to bribe each of n nodes with slightly more than $d + ϵ. Counterintuitively, Fig. 16 shows that a system that distributes a reward broadly among nodes signaling an alert is far weaker than one that concentrates the reward in the hands of a single watchdog. Example parameters: Consider a (first-tier) network with n = 100 nodes, each depositing $d = $20K. This network would have a total of $2M deposited'},\n",

Example parameters: Consider a (first-tier) network with n = 100 nodes, each depositing $d = $20K. This network would have a total of $2M deposited but would be protected against a briber with budget $100M = $dn2/2. Increasing the number of oracles is more effective than increasing $d, of course, and can have a dramatic effect: a network with n = 300 nodes and deposits $d = $20K would be protected against a briber with budget up to $900M. Note that a staking system can in many cases protect smart contracts representing more value than the offered level of bribery protection. This is because an adversary attacking these contracts cannot extract the full value in many cases. For example, a Chainlink-powered contract securing $1B in value may only require security against a briber with $100M in resource because such an adversary can feasibly extract a profit of only 10% of the value of the contract. Note: The idea that the value of a network can grow quadratically is expressed in the well known Metcalfe’s Law [167, 235], which states that the value of a network grows quadratically in the number of connected entities. Metcalfe’s Law, however, arises from growth in the number of potential pairwise network connections, a dif- ferent phenomenon than that underlying quadratic staking impact in our incentive mechanism. 9.4.3 Realization of Second Tier Two operational features facilitate realization of a high-reliability second tier: (1) Second-tier adjudication should be a rare event in oracle networks and therefore can be significantly more costly than normal operation of the first tier and (2) Assuming optimistically accepted reports-or contracts whose execution can await arbitration- the second tier need not execute in real time. These features result in a range of configuration options for the second tier to meet the requirements of particular DONs. As an example approach, a second tier committee can consist of nodes selected by a DON (i.e., first tier) from the longest-serving and most reliable nodes in the Chainlink network. In addition to considerable relevant operational experience, the operators of such nodes have a considerable implicit incentive in FFO that motivates a desire to ensure that the Chainlink network remains highly reliable. They also have publicly available performance histories that provide transparency into their reliability. Second- tier nodes, it is worth noting, need not be participants in the first-tier network, and may adjudicate faults across multiple first-tier networks. Nodes in a given DON can pre-designate and publicly commit to a set of n′ such nodes as constituting the second-tier committee for that DON. Additionally, DON nodes publish a parameter k′ ≤n′ that determines the number of second-tier votes required to penalize a first-tier node. When an alert is generated for a given report, the members of the second tier vote on the correctness of the values provided by each of the first-tier nodes. Any first-tier node that receives k′ negative votes forfeits its deposits to the watchdog node. Because of the rareness of adjudication and opportunity for extended-time execution noted above, in contrast to the first tier, nodes in the second tier can: 1. Be highly compensated for conducting adjudication. 2. Draw on'},\n",

Be highly compensated for conducting adjudication. 2. Draw on additional data sources, beyond even the diverse set used by the first- tier. 3. Rely on manual and/or expert inspection and intervention, e.g., to identify and reconcile errors in source data and distinguish between an honest node relaying faulty data and a misbehaving node. We emphasize that the approach we have just described for selection of second- tier nodes and policy governing adjudication represents just a point within a large design space of possible realizations of the second tier. Our incentive mechanism offers complete flexibility as to how the second tier is realized. Individual DONs can thus constitute and set rules for their second tiers that meet the particular requirements and expectations of participating nodes and users. DECO and Town Crier as adjudication tools: It is essential for the second tier in our mechanism to be able to distinguish between adversarial first-tier nodes that intentionally produce incorrect reports and honest first-tier nodes that unintentionally relay data that is incorrect at the source. Only then can the second tier implement slashing to disincentivize cheating, the goal of our mechanism. DECO and Town Crier are powerful tools that can enable second-tier nodes to make this critical distinction reliably. Second-tier nodes may in some cases be able to directly query the data source used by a first-tier node or use ADO Section 7.1 in order to check whether an incorrect report resulted from a faulty data source. In other cases, however, second tier nodes may lack direct access to a first-tier node’s data source. In such cases, correct adjudication would appear to be infeasible or require a reliance on subjective judgment. Previous oracle dispute systems have relied upon inefficient, escalating rounds of voting to address such challenges. Using DECO or Town Crier, however, a first tier node can prove correct behavior to second-tier nodes. (See Section 3.6.2 for details on the two systems.) Specifically, if the second tier node identifies a first-tier node as having output a faulty report value ˜r, the first-tier node can use DECO or Town Crier to generate tamperproof evidence for second-tier nodes that it is correctly relaying ˜r correctly from a (TLS-enabled) source recognized as authoritative by the DON. Critically, the first-tier node can do this without second-tier nodes requiring direct access to the data source.17 Consequently, correct adjudication is feasible in Chainlink for any desired data source. 9.4.4 Misreporting Insurance The strong bribery resistance achieved by our staking mechanism relies fundamentally on slashed funds being awarded to alerters. Without a monetary reward, alerters would have no direct incentive to reject bribes. As a result, however, slashed funds are not available to compensate users harmed by incorrect reports, e.g., users that lose money when incorrect price data is relayed to a smart contract. By assumption, incorrect reports don’t pose a problem if reports are accepted by a contract only after potential adjudication, i.e., action by the second tier.

As explained above, though, to achieve the best possible performance, contracts may instead rely optimistically on the mechanism to enforce correct reporting, meaning that they accept reports before potential second-tier adjudication. Indeed, such optimistic behavior is safe in our model assuming rational adversaries whose budgets do not exceed the staking impact of the mechanism. Users concerned about the improbable event of a mechanism failure resulting from, e.g., adversaries with overwhelming financial resources, may wish to employ an addi- tional layer of economic security in the form of misreporting insurance. We know of multiple insurers already intending to offer smart-contract-backed policies of this kind for Chainlink-secured protocols in the near future, including through innovative mech- anisms such as DAOs, e.g., [7]. The existence of performance history for Chainlink nodes and other data about nodes such as their stake amounts provides an exception- ally strong basis for actuarial assessments of risk, making it possible to price policies in ways that are inexpensive for policyholders yet sustainable for insurers. 17With Town Crier, it is additionally possible for first-tier nodes to locally generate attestations of correctness for the reports they output and provide these attestations to second-tier nodes on an as-needed basis. Basic forms of misreporting insurance can be implemented in a trustworthy and efficient manner using smart contracts. As a simple example, a parametric insurance contract SCins can compensate policyholders automatically if our incentive mechanism’s second tier identifies an error in a report generated in the first tier. A user U that wishes to purchase an insurance policy, e.g., the creator of a target contract SC, can submit a request to a decentralized insurer for an policy amount $M on the contract. On approving U, the insurer can set an ongoing (e.g., monthly) premium of $P in SCins. While U pays the premium, her policy remains active. If a reporting failure occurs in SC, the result will be the emission of a pair (r1, r2) of conflicting reports for SC, where r1 is signed by the first tier in our mechanism and r2, the corresponding corrected report, is signed by the second tier. If the U furnishes such a valid pair (r1, r2) to SCins, the contract automatically pays her $M, provided her premium payments are up-to-date. 9.5 Single-Round Variant The protocol described in the previous subsection requires that the second-tier com- mittee wait n rounds to determine whether a watchdog has raised an alert. This requirement holds even in the optimistic case, i.e., when the first tier is functioning correctly. For users unwilling to accept reports optimistically, i.e., prior to potential adjudication, the delay associated with that approach would be unworkable. For this reason, we are also exploring alternative protocols that require just one round. In this approach, all oracle nodes submit secret bits indicating whether or not they wish to raise an alert. The second-tier committee then checks these values in priority order. To provide a rough sketch, such a scheme might involve the following steps: 1.

Anonymous tips: Any oracle node can submit an anonymous tip α to the second- tier committee in the same round that watchdog bits are submitted. This tip α is a message indicating that an alert has been raised for the current report. 3. Watchdog bit checking: The second-tier committee reveals oracle nodes’ watchdog bits in priority order. Note that nodes must send no alert watchdog bits when they don’t alert: oth- erwise, traffic analysis reveals all nodes’ bits. The protocol does reveal the no alert watchdog bits of nodes with higher priority than the highest-priority alerting watchdog. Observe that what is revealed is identical with that of our n-round protocol. Re- wards are also distributed identically with that scheme, i.e., the first identified watchdog receives the slashed deposits of nodes that have submitted incorrect reports. The use of anonymous tips enables the second-tier committee to remain non- interactive in cases where no alert has been raised, reducing communication complexity in the common case. Note that any watchdog that raises an alert has an economic in- centive to submit an anonymous tip: If no tip is submitted, no reward is paid to any node. To ensure that the sender Oi of an anonymous tip α cannot be identified by the adversary based on network data, the anonymous tip can be sent over an anonymous channel, e.g, via Tor, or, more practically, proxied via a cloud service provider. To authenticate the tip as originating with O, Oi can sign α using a ring signature [39, 192]. Alternatively, to prevent unattributable denial-of-service attacks against the second- tier committee by a malicious oracle node, α can be an anonymous credential with revocable anonymity [73]. This protocol, while practically achievable, has somewhat heavyweight engineering requirements (which we are exploring ways to reduce). First-tier nodes, for instance, must communicate directly with second-tier nodes, requiring maintenance of a direc- tory. The need for anonymous channels and ring signatures adds to the engineering complexity of the scheme. Finally, there is a special trust requirement briefly discussed in the note below. We are therefore also exploring simpler schemes that still achieve super-linear staking impact, but perhaps less than quadratic, in which a briber asymp- totically needs resources of at least $n log n, for example. Some of the schemes under consideration involve random selection of a strict subset of nodes to act as watchdogs, in which case prospective bribery becomes an especially powerful attack. Remark: The security of this single-round staking mechanism requires untappable channels between oracle and second-tier nodes-a standard requirement in coercion- resistant systems, e.g., voting [82, 138], and a reasonable one in practice. Additionally, however, a node Oi that seeks to cooperate with a briber can construct its secret shares in such a way as to show the briber that it has encoded a particular value. For example, if Oi does not know which nodes the briber controls, then Oi can submit 0-valued shares to all committee members. The briber can then'},\n",

With an interactive protocol in which each second-tier node adds a randomization factor to shares, the best the briber can do is enforce selection by Oi of a random watchdog bit. 9.6 Implicit-Incentive Framework (IIF) FFO is a form of implicit incentive for correct behavior in the Chainlink network. It functions like explicit stake, i.e., deposits, in that it helps enforce economic security for the network. In other words, FFO should be included as part of the (effective) deposit $d of a node in the network. The question is: How do we measure FFO and other forms of implicit incentive within the Chainlink network? The Implicit-Incentive Framework (IIF) is a set of principles and techniques that we plan to develop for this purpose. Blockchain systems provide many forms of unprecedented transparency, and the high-trust records of node performance they create are a springboard for our vision of how the IIF will work. Here we very briefly sketch ideas on key elements of the IIF. The IIF itself will consist of a set of factors we identify as important in evaluating implicit incentives, along with mechanisms for publishing relevant data in a high- assurance form for consumption by analytics algorithms. Different Chainlink users may wish to use the IIF in different ways, e.g., giving different weighting to different factors. We expect analytics services to arise in the community that help users apply the IIF according to their individual risk-evaluation preferences, and our goal is to facilitate such services by ensuring their access to high-assurance and timely supporting data, as we discuss below (Section 9.6.4). 9.6.1 Future Fee Opportunity Nodes participate in the Chainlink ecosystem to earn a share of the fees that the net- works pay out for any of the various services we have described in this paper, from ordinary data feeds to advanced services such as decentralized identity, fair sequencing, and confidentiality-preserving DeFi. Fees in the Chainlink network support node oper- ators’ costs for, e.g., running servers, acquiring necessary data licenses, and maintaining a global staffto ensure high uptime. FFO denotes the service fees, net of expenses, that a node stands to gain in the future-or lose should it demonstrate faulty behavior. FFO is a form of stake that helps secure the network. A helpful feature of FFO is the fact that on-chain data (supplemented by off-chain data) establish a high-trust record of a node’s history, enabling computation of FFO in a transparent, empirically driven manner. A simple, first-order measure of FFO can derive from the average net revenue of a node over a period of time (i.e., gross revenue minus operating expenses). FFO may then be calculated as, e.g., the net present value [114] of cumulative future net revenue, in other words, the time-discounted value of all future earnings. Node revenue can be volatile, however, as shown for example in Fig. 17.'},\n",

FFO may then be calculated as, e.g., the net present value [114] of cumulative future net revenue, in other words, the time-discounted value of all future earnings. Node revenue can be volatile, however, as shown for example in Fig. 17. More importantly, node revenue may not follow a distribution that is stationary over time. Consequently, other factors we plan to explore in estimating FFO include: • Performance history: An operator’s performance history-including the correct- ness and timeliness of its reports, as well as its up time-provides an objective touchstone for users to evaluate its reliability. Performance history will thus provide a critical factor in users’ selection of oracle nodes (or, with the advent of DONs, their selection of DONs). A strong performance history is likely to correlate with high ongoing revenue.18 18An important research question we intend to address is detection of falsified service volumes. Figure 17: Revenue earned by Chainlink nodes on a single data feed (ETH-USD) during a representative week in March 2021. • Data access: While oracles may obtain many forms of data from open APIs, certain forms of data or certain high-quality sources may be available only on a subscription basis or through contractual agreements. Privileged access to certain data sources can play a role in creating a stable revenue stream. • DON participation: With the advent of DONs, communities of nodes will come together to provide particular services. We expect that many DONs will include operators on a selective basis, establishing participation in reputable DONs as a privileged market position that helps ensure a consistent source of revenue. • Cross-platform activity: Some node operators may have well-established pres- ences and performance track records in other contexts, e.g., as PoS validators or data providers in non-blockchain contexts. Their performance in these other sys- tems (when data on it is available in a trustworthy form) can inform evaluation of their performance history. Similarly, faulty behavior in the Chainlink network can jeopardize revenue in these other systems by driving away users, i.e., FFO can extend across platforms. 9.6.2 Speculative FFO Node operators participate in the Chainlink network not just to generate revenue from operations, but to create and position themselves to take advantage of new opportu- nities to run jobs. In other words, expenditure by oracle nodes in the network is also a positive statement about the future of DeFi and other smart-contract application domains as well as emerging non-blockchain applications of oracle networks. Node op- erators today earn the fees available on existing Chainlink networks and simultaneously These are loosely analogous to fake reviews on internet sites, except that the problem is easier in the oracle setting because we have a definitive record of whether the goods, i.e., reports, were ordered and delivered-as opposed to, e.g., physical goods ordered in online shops. Put another way, in the oracle setting, performance can be validated, even if customer veracity can’t. build a reputation, performance history, and operational expertise that will position them advantageously to earn fees available in future networks (contingent, of course, on honest behavior). The nodes operating in the Chainlink ecosystem today will in this sense have an advantage over newcomers in earning the fees as additional Chainlink services become available. This advantage applies to new operators,'},\n",

The nodes operating in the Chainlink ecosystem today will in this sense have an advantage over newcomers in earning the fees as additional Chainlink services become available. This advantage applies to new operators, as well as tech- nology companies with established reputations; for example, T-Systems, a traditional technology provider (subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom), and Kraken, a large centralized exchange, have established early presences in the Chainlink ecosystem [28, 143]. Such participation by oracle nodes in future opportunities may be regarded itself as a kind of speculative FFO, and thus constitutes a form of stake in the Chainlink network. 9.6.3 External Reputation The IIF as we have described it can operate in a network with strictly pseudonymous operators, i.e., without disclosure of the people or real-world entities involved. One potentially important factor for user selection of providers, however, is external reputation. By external reputation, we mean the perception of trustworthiness attach- ing to real-world identities, rather than pseudonyms. Reputational risk attaching to real-world identities can be viewed as a form of implicit incentive. We view reputation through the lens of the IIF, i.e., in a cryptoeconomic sense, as a means of establishing cross-platform activity that may be incorporated into FFO estimates. The benefit of using external reputation as a factor in estimates of FFO, as opposed to pseudonymous linkage, is that external reputation links performance not just to an operator’s existing activities, but also to future ones. If, for instance, a bad reputation attaches to an individual person, it can taint that person’s future enterprises. Put an- other way, external reputation can capture a broader swath of FFO than pseudonymous performance records, as the impact of malfeasance attaching to a person or established company is harder to escape than that associated with a pseudonymous operation. Chainlink is compatible with decentralized identity technologies (Section 4.3) that can provide support for the use of external reputation in the IIF. Such technologies can validate and thereby help ensure the veracity of operators’ asserted real-world identities.19 9.6.4 Open IIF Analytics The IIF, as we have noted, aims to provide reliable open-source data and tools for implicit-incentive analytics. The goal is to enable providers within the community to develop analytics tailored to the risk-assessment needs of different parts of the Chainlink user base. 19Decentralized identity credentials can also, where desired, embellish pseudonyms with validated supplementary information. For example, a node operator could in principle use such credentials to prove that it is a Fortune 500 company, without revealing which one. A considerable amount of historical data regarding nodes’ revenue and performance resides on chain in a high-trust, immutable form. Our goal, however, is to provide the most comprehensive possible data, including data on behaviors that are visible only off chain, such as Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) or DON activity. Such data can potentially be voluminous. The best way to store it and ensure its integrity, i.e., protect it from tampering, we believe, will be with the help of DONs, using techniques discussed in Section 3.3. Some incentives lend themselves to direct forms of measurement, such as staking deposits and basic FFO. Others, such as speculative FFO and reputation, are harder to measure in an objective manner, but we believe that'},\n",

Others, such as speculative FFO and reputation, are harder to measure in an objective manner, but we believe that supporting forms of data, including historical growth of the Chainlink ecosystem, social-media metrics of reputation, etc., can support IIF analytics models even for these harder-to-quantify elements. We can imagine that dedicated DONs arise specifically to monitor, validate, and record data relating to off-chain performance records of nodes, as well as other data used in the IIF, such as validated identity information. These DONs can provide uni- form, high-trust IIF data for any analytics providers serving the Chainlink community. They will also provide a golden record that makes the claims of analytics providers independently verifiable by the community. 9.7 Putting It All Together: Node Operator Incentives Synthesizing our discussions above on explicit and implicit incentives for node operators provides a holistic view of the ways that node operators participate in and benefit from the Chainlink network. As a conceptual guide, we can express the total assets at stake by a given Chainlink node operator $S in a rough, stylized form as: $S ≈$D + $F + $FS + $R, where: • $D is the aggregate of all explicitly deposited stake across all networks in which the operator participates; • $F is the net present value of the aggregate of all FFO across all networks in which the operator participates; • $FS is the net present value of the speculative FFO of the operator; and • $R is the reputational equity of the operator outside the Chainlink ecosystem that might be jeopardized by identified misbehavior in its oracle nodes. While largely conceptual, this rough equality helpfully shows that there is a mul- tiplicity of economic factors favoring high-reliability performance by Chainlink nodes. All of these factors other than $D are present in today’s Chainlink networks. 9.8 The Virtuous Cycle of Economic Security The combination of super-linear staking impact with representation of fee payments as future fee opportunity (FFO) in the IIF can lead to what we call the virtuous cycle of economic security in an oracle network. This can be seen as a kind of economy of scale. As the total amount secured by a particular network rises, the amount of additional stake it takes to add a fixed amount of economic security decreases as does the average per-user cost. It’s therefore cheaper, in terms of fees, for a user to join an already-existing network than to achieve the same increase in network economic security by creating a new network. Importantly, the addition of each new user lowers the cost of the service for all previous users of that network. Given a particular fee structure (e.g. a particular yield rate on the amount staked), if the total fees earned by a network increases, this incentivizes the flow of additional stake into the network to secure it at a higher rate. Specifically, if the total stake an individual node may hold in the system is capped, then when new fee payments enter the system, raising its FFO, the number of nodes n will increase. Thanks to the super-linear staking impact of our incentive'},\n",

Specifically, if the total stake an individual node may hold in the system is capped, then when new fee payments enter the system, raising its FFO, the number of nodes n will increase. Thanks to the super-linear staking impact of our incentive system design, the economic security of the system will rise faster than n, e.g., as n2 in the mechanism we sketch in Section 9.4. As a result, the average cost for economic security-i.e., amount of stake contributing a dollar of economic security-will drop. The network can therefore charge its users lower fees. Assuming that demand for oracle services is elastic (see, e.g., [31] for a brief explanation), demand will rise, generating additional fees and FFO. We illustrate this point with the following example. Example 5. Since the economic security of an oracle network with our incentive scheme is $dn2 for stake $dn, the economic security contributed by a dollar of stake is n and thus the average cost per dollar of economic security-i.e, amount of stake contributing to a dollar of economic security-is 1/n. Consider a network in which the economic incentives consist entirely of FFO, capped at $d ≤$10K per node. Suppose the network has n = 3 nodes. Then the average cost per dollar of economic security is about $0.33. Suppose that the total FFO of the network rises above $30K (e.g., to $31K). Given the cap on per-node FFO, the network grows to (at least) n = 4. Now the average cost per dollar of economic security drops to about $0.25. We illustrate the full virtuous cycle of economic security in oracle networks schemat- ically in Fig. 18. We emphasize that the virtuous cycle of economic security derives from the effect of users pooling their fees. It is their collective FFO that works in favor of larger network sizes and thus greater collective security. We also note that the virtuous cycle of economic security works in favor of DONs achieving financial sustainability. Once created, DONs that address user needs should grow to and beyond the point at which revenue from fees exceed operational costs for oracle nodes. Figure 18: Schematic of the virtuous cycle of Chainlink staking. A rise in user fee payments to an oracle network 1⃝causes it to grow, leading to growth in its economic security 2⃝. This super-linear growth realizes economies of scale in Chainlink networks 3⃝. Specifically, it means a reduction in the average cost of economic security , i.e., the per-dollar economic security arising from fee payments or other sources of stake increases. Lower costs, passed along to users, stimulate increased demand for oracle services 4⃝. 9.9 Additional Factors Driving Network Growth As the Chainlink ecosystem continues to expand, we believe that its attractiveness to users and importance as infrastructure for the blockchain economy will accelerate. The value provided by oracle networks is super-linear, meaning that it grows faster than the size of the networks themselves. This growth in value derives from both economies of scale-greater per-user cost efficiency as service volumes increase-and network effects-an increase of network utility as users adopt DONs more widely.

As existing smart contracts continue to see more value secured and entirely new smart contract applications are made possible by more decentralized services, the total use of and aggregate fees paid to DONs should grow. Increasing pools of fees in turn translate into the means and incentive to create even more decentralized services, resulting in a virtuous cycle. This virtuous cycle solves a critical chicken-and-egg problem in the hybrid smart contract ecosystem: Innovative smart contract features often require decentralized services that don’t yet exist (e.g., new DeFi markets often require new data feeds) yet need sufficient economic demand to come into existence. The pooling of fees by various smart contracts for existing DONs will signal demand for additional decentralized services from a growing user base, giving rise to their creation by DONs and an ongoing enablement of new and varied hybrid smart contracts. In summary, we believe that the growth in network security driven by virtuous cycles in the Chainlink staking mechanism exemplifies larger patterns of growth that the Chainlink network can help bring about in an on-chain economy for decentralized services. Conclusion In this paper, we have set forth a vision for Chainlink’s evolution. The main theme in this vision is oracle networks’ ability to provide a much broader range of service for smart contracts than mere data delivery. Using DONs as a foundation for the decentral- ized services of the future, Chainlink will aim to provide performant, confidentiality- enhanced oracle functionality. Its oracle networks will offer strong trust minimization through a combination of principled cryptoeconomic mechanisms such as staking and carefully conceived guard rails and service-level enforcement on relying main chains. DONs will also help layer-2 systems enforce flexible, fair ordering policies on transac- tions, as well as reduced gas costs for mempool-routed transactions. Taken together, these capabilities all drive in the direction of secure and richly functional hybrid smart contracts. The flexibility of DONs will enhance existing Chainlink services and give rise to many additional smart contract features and applications. Among these are seamless connection to a wide variety of off-chain systems, decentralized identity creation from existing data, priority channels to help ensure timely delivery of infrastructure-critical transactions, and confidentiality-preserving DeFi instruments. The vision we’ve set forth here is ambitious. In the short term, we seek to empower hybrid contracts to accomplish goals beyond the reach of smart contracts today, while in the long term we aim to realize a decentralized metalayer. Happily we can draw on new tools and ideas-ranging from consensus algorithms to zero-knowledge proof systems-that the community is developing as the fruit of rapidly evolving research. Similarly, we expect to prioritize implementation of the ideas in this paper in response to the needs of Chainlink’s community of users. We look forward to the next stage in our quest to empower smart contracts through universal connectivity and establish decentralized technologies as the backbone of the world’s next generation of financial and legal systems.

MIT Press Cambridge, 1995. A Glossary This glossary is intended to define important terms in the body of the paper. Square brackets denote the section of the main body of the paper (if any) in which a given term receives treatment. Boldface terms within definitions indicate a corresponding glossary entry. • Authenticated data origination (ADO) [Section 7.1]: The use of digital signatures by original data sources to authenticate data fed from their APIs. By authenticating data provenance, ADO can help strengthen the integrity of oracle reports. • Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT): A term used of distributed systems pro- tocols such as blockchains. BFT is the property of ensuring security even if a (minority) fraction of nodes / servers behave in a Byzantine, i.e., arbitrarily ma- licious, manner. The term Byzantine also conveniently describes the mechanics of most Byzantine-Fault Tolerant protocols. • Cryptoeconomics: A domain-specific form of mechanism that leverages cryp- tographic techniques and digital assets to create desirable equilibria within de- centralized systems. • DECO [Section 3.6.2]: Short for decentralized oracle, DECO is a new cryp- tographic protocol that enables a user (or oracle) to prove statements in zero- knowledge about data'},\n",

       "  'text': 'term used of distributed systems pro- tocols such as blockchains. BFT is the property of ensuring security even if a (minority) fraction of nodes / servers behave in a Byzantine, i.e., arbitrarily ma- licious, manner. The term Byzantine also conveniently describes the mechanics of most Byzantine-Fault Tolerant protocols. • Cryptoeconomics: A domain-specific form of mechanism that leverages cryp- tographic techniques and digital assets to create desirable equilibria within de- centralized systems. • DECO [Section 3.6.2]: Short for decentralized oracle, DECO is a new cryp- tographic protocol that enables a user (or oracle) to prove statements in zero- knowledge about data obtained from HTTPS-enabled servers. DECO conse- quently allows private data from unmodified web servers to be relayed safely by oracle networks. (It does not allow data to be sent by a prover directly on chain.) DECO has narrower capabilities than Town Crier, but unlike Town Crier, does not rely on a trusted execution environment. • Exchange: A platform for digital-asset trading. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes) are exchanges realized in part or full as smart contracts. • Fair Sequencing Services (FSS) [Section 5]: Chainlink’s functionality to bring blockchain users the innovation of first-come, first-serve services like the kind you can get at a deli. FSS helps prevent front-running and other schemes that arbitrageurs use to gain a technical advantage over ordinary users in existing smart contract systems. • Front-running: A profit-making strategy in financial systems such as public blockchains in which a trader, observing an incoming transaction, exploits it by speedily placing her own transaction first. The term has a narrower meaning on Wall Street than in the blockchain community, but an even more thriving community of practitioners. • Future fee opportunity: The net revenue a Chainlink oracle may expect to receive from service payments from customers in the future. Loss of such fees in cases of malfeasance represents an opportunity cost. • Game theory: Mathematically formal study of strategic interaction. A game is a model of such an interaction, typically in the real world, that codifies sets of actions available to participants in the game, known as players. • Layer-2 systems: A class of approaches to improving the performance- both transaction throughput and latency-of blockchains. Layer-2 systems involve off-chain processing of transactions, followed by periodic reconciliation / syncing with the target blockchain. Rollups are one example. • Mechanism / mechanism design (MD): Sometimes called “inverse game- theory,” MD is the science of designing games, called mechanisms, that incen- tivize particular behaviors by participants, conventionally known as players. • Public-key infrastructure (PKI): A system for secure creation and manage- ment of a mapping of identities to public keys. • Rollup [Section 6.3]: A variant on the classical computer science transaction- processing approach known as batching, now available in fruit flavors. Rollups can help increase transaction processing speeds and throughputs, and are a promising approach to scaling blockchains to handle high transaction loads. A rollup involves off-chain construction of batches of transactions, followed by on- chain submission. Two popular rollup design approaches are: - Optimistic rollups: A class of rollup schemes in which transaction batches are submitted on chain without verification. Their correctness is enforced by allowing participants to mount challenges to incorrect rollups, and using staking as an economic incentive for such challenges. - zk-Rollups: A class of rollup schemes in which ‘zk’ inexplicably denotes “zero-knowledge,” a property that zk-Rollups need not and often do not have. zk-Rollups use succinct arguments of knowledge, i.e., compact cryp- tographic proofs or correct computation, to enable efficient verification when submitted on chain. • Super-linear / quadratic staking impact [Section 9.4.2]: An adversary can corrupt rational,'},\n",

Given an adversary with budget $B(n), and n participating oracle nodes, each with a fixed staking deposit $d, we say that a staking scheme has super-linear impact if adver- sarial success requires B(n) that grows asymptotically faster than n. Quadratic impact means that B(n) grows asymptotically as n2. • Staking [Section 9]: A means of reinforcing the security of a decentralized system using rigorously quantifiable economic incentives. In a staking scheme, partici- pants provide a cryptocurrency deposit that is partially or fully forfeited in cases of participant deviation from a blockchain protocol. In the Chainlink setting, oracle nodes perform staking to ensure correct reports; they forfeit stake upon failure to produce a correct report. • Transaction-Execution Framework (TEF) [Section 6]: A Decentralized Or- acle Network framework for layer-2 systems that implements oracle support and Fair Sequencing Services. • Town Crier [Section 3.6.2]: An oracle technology that uses a trusted execution environment (TEE) to enforce integrity and confidentiality on oracle data and computation. Town Crier has capabilities that subsume those of DECO, but requires trust in a TEE. • Trusted Execution Environment (TEE): An execution environment for ap- plications, often with special-purpose hardware support. A TEE aims to pro- vide strong security properties such as confidentiality and application integrity, i.e., tamper-resistance for software. TEEs are a work in progress, but one that promises to have a large industry impact. • Trust minimization [Section 7]: A common term in the blockchain industry cleverly crafted to mean the opposite of what it sounds like it should mean. Trust minimization refers to a desirable design feature in decentralized systems: Strong assurance of correct behavior under limited assumptions about the trustworthi- ness of system components. B DON Interface: Further Details In this appendix, we provide more details on the DON interface outlined in Section 3. We treat the three computing resources of networking, computation, and storage re- spectively in Appendix B.1, B.2, and B.3. B.1 Networking Oracle systems have arisen to address a limitation in basic blockchain protocols: public / permissionless blockchains cannot securely fetch data from external systems, such as web servers.20 DONs aim to support application-level adapters between blockchains and off-chain systems in a general, flexible, and extensible form. In this section, we discuss the techniques DONs will use to construct secure adapters and to ensure their availability. We also give some examples of their application. Most of the techniques we describe have not been codified before in a Chainlink whitepaper. They can be applied in Chainlink as it is architected today, i.e., do not require DONs, and we expect that some of them will be. 20Most data of interest is not digitally signed by the originating web server. Thus data fetched by a single miner producing a block would be vulnerable to tampering. Even in committee-based consen- sus protocols, e.g., [103, 120], there would be formidable challenges in realizing oracle functionality, including data availability failures (and their potential impact on performance and/or transaction censorship), added'},\n",

Even in committee-based consen- sus protocols, e.g., [103, 120], there would be formidable challenges in realizing oracle functionality, including data availability failures (and their potential impact on performance and/or transaction censorship), added low-level complexity, access restrictions on some data sources (e.g., proprietary sources), etc. We characterize the security of an adapter in terms of the classic CIA (confiden- tiality, integrity, availability) triad. Of greatest importance in an oracle system is data integrity. Integrity here means that an adversary cannot tamper with data relayed from the source to the DON (or vice versa). In some circumstances, a channel should also provide confidentiality. Con- fidentiality means that an adversary learns only the data that a protocol is designed to send over the channel. (We provide more precise notions.) A channel should exhibit availability, meaning that the channel is created and carries data in a timely way in response to relying parties’ needs. Finally, as an addition to the triad, we note that accountability is important to ensure the proper functioning of oracle systems: In cases of failure, it should be possible to identify (and penalize) malfunctioning nodes. B.1.1 Integrity Transport Layer Security (TLS)-the dominant internet protocol for establishing a se- cure channel between a client and a host-has a serious inherent limitation: It provides integrity only for the two communicating parties. It does not digitally sign data in a way that supports proof to a third party that data originated with the host (or client), and proposals for this purpose, e.g., [9, 191], are currently seeing very limited adoption. Some data of interest for blockchain systems may be digitally signed by its producers, and we discuss approaches to support this potentially beneficial practice in Section 7.1. Today, however, the vast majority of web data isn’t digitally signed. DONs therefore incorporate purpose-built mechanisms for ensuring the integrity of a report r communicated to the DON from one or more other sources. These come in three forms, each with its own associated trust and operational model. To describe the functioning of the three mechanisms, we consider a simple model in which players aim to ensure the integrity of what we call an enhanced report r = (˜r, sid, S), where a basic report payload ˜r is tagged with: (1) sid, a session identifier and (2) an identifier S for the source / entity with which the report originated. The value sid provides a unique label for the protocol context in which ˜r is sent, and may include such information as a unique identifier of the relying smart contract, an unique identifier of the query to which the report corresponds, etc. We refer to an enhanced report simply as a report where clear from context. We denote by ρi = (r [, w]) a report that an oracle node Oi writes to L, where w denotes an (optional) witness. We refer to w (with or without a witness) as a recorded report. Because players’ messages on L are authenticated, i.e., signed by the players that post them, writing ρi can serve as an endorsement by Oi in a relying protocol. DONs support three basic mechanisms for ensuring the integrity of queries and reports, meaning their being relayed'},\n",

Because players’ messages on L are authenticated, i.e., signed by the players that post them, writing ρi can serve as an endorsement by Oi in a relying protocol. DONs support three basic mechanisms for ensuring the integrity of queries and reports, meaning their being relayed from claimed source S without tampering. They are: • Cryptographic proofs: Digital signing of r by a source S with public key pk, i.e., ρ = (r, w = Sigpk[r]), provides a direct assurance of the integrity of the message. • Trusted execution environments (TEEs) / Town Crier: An application instance A with public key pkA running in a fully featured TEE, such as Intel SGX, can generate an attestation, that is, a digitally signed witness w = SigpkA[r]. Assuming trust in the TEE, then, the recorded report ρA = (r, w = SigpkA[r]) ensures the integrity of r. • Thresholding: Any subset of f + 1 players generating recorded reports ρi = (r, Sigpki[r]) or combined or aggregate witness ρO = (r, SigO[r]) provides a collec- tive view of r as originating correctly with source S. Thresholding and TEEs are complementary. They can be used simultaneously for a stronger combined security assurance, in the sense that integrity is assured if at least one of the two mechanisms is sound. We may extend our definition of integrity to encompass recording a transformation conf(˜r) of ˜r, rather than ˜r itself. This extension is useful for confidentiality, as discussed below. Untrustworthy sources: A given data source S may, of course, provide untrustwor- thy data. Adapter integrity in the sense we have defined it does not include mechanisms to address corrupt sources. The predominant mechanism used in oracle systems is ag- gregation over sources. For example, if an asset’s price reports r1, r2, r3 are fetched from sources S1, S2, S3, an aggregate report r = median(r1, r2, r3), given one faulty source, r will be the value reported by a correct source. Ensuring correct aggregation is a problem of computation integrity, as discussed in Appendix B.2. B.1.2 Confidentiality We say that an adapter has weak confidentiality if O learns both the query q and report data r generated by the adapter. Weakly confidential protocols may still provide other forms of confidentiality, however: the adapter may place only partial information about (q, r) on L and thus partially conceal (q, r) from an observer, and auxiliary data in the protocol may still be confidential. We say an adapter has strong confidentiality, on the other hand, if q and r are partially or fully concealed from O. It’s not obvious at first glance how to achieve strong confidentiality: How, after all, can O process a hidden query and manage a hidden report? DONs can use DECO [234] and/or Town Crier [233] to achieve strong confidentiality in adapters. See Appendix C for an example. DECO and Town Crier are designed to provide legacy compatibility, i.e., the ability to use existing data sources, in a confidentiality-preserving way. An alternative ap- proach is to change the output of data sources by digitally signing it and providing confidentiality features, as in TLS-N [191], a nicely complementary approach that we will also explore, and to a limited extent in OpenID Connect [9], an identity-oriented data-signing protocol that runs on'},\n",

B.1.3 Availability The availability of an adapter depends on both the availability of the system to which it is connecting as well as the availability of the DON nodes responsible for implementing the adapter. While availability mechanisms may be adapter-specific, we expect that they will commonly rely on a few basic techniques already used or slated for inclusion in the current version of Chainlink. One, of course, is redundancy, i.e., having multiple nodes operate the channel. Another is the use of cryptoeconomic incentives to reinforce fast channel operation; for example, while redundant nodes receive payment for their services, a premium may be paid for fast execution, e.g., a reward for the first node to relay data to the DON from an off-chain system. See Appendix B.1 for further details on adapters in DONs. B.2 Computation In their support of layer-2 scaling approaches-whether based on optimistic computing or validity proofs-DONs offer the possibility of significant performance improvements for smart contracts. By employing additional technologies, DONs can provide further performance enhancement and also support various forms of confidentiality, whether for oracle data as an adjunct to privacy-preserving layer-2 schemes (e.g., [217]), or to provide privacy enhancement for schemes in which it isn’t present. Zero-knowledge proof (argument) systems, such as zk-SNARKs [126], zk-STARKs [38], and Bulletproofs [56, 66], are powerful tools for privacy and will play an important role in the evolution of confidentiality-preserving smart contract systems [149], as they do, for instance, in DECO. It is worth noting that the goal of proving statements in zero- knowledge to an oracle node admits use of a new form of zero-knowledge proof with a designated verifier (i.e., a proof that is verifiable only by a particular entity, not pub- licly) [220]; such schemes can greatly outperform more general-purpose zero-knowledge proof systems. We expect that zero-knowledge proofs will play an important role in trustworthy and confidential relaying of oracle results, in both adapters and executa- bles. But they have a critical limitation: They don’t conceal secrets from the prover. To enable more general confidentiality-preserving functionality will require addi- tional techniques. These same techniques can also enforce integrity, i.e., help ensure that computation is performed correctly. We briefly discuss the roles of Trusted Exe- cution Environments (TEEs) and Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) in the evo- lution of Chainlink. B.2.1 Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) TEEs such as Intel SGX [229, 133] and Keystone [152] allow applications to exe- cute within a protected environment, known as an enclave, that in principle protects both their integrity and confidentiality. TEEs are designed to realize a powerful and very general functionality [183], one that encompasses even powerful cryptographic primitives such as virtual black-box obfuscation, that are provably unrealizable using cryptography alone [27, 175]. The idea of leveraging TEEs for smart contracts was introduced in [139, 233] and several general-purpose frameworks for this purpose have since emerged [58, 80, 99]. We expect that TEEs will eventually play a role in the Chainlink network, as they are the basis'},\n",

We expect that TEEs will eventually play a role in the Chainlink network, as they are the basis for Town Crier [233], and Chainlink already supports TEE-based blockchain systems, e.g., [8]. As the technology continues to mature, we believe it will play an increasingly important role in blockchain systems in general, and Chainlink in particular. Concerns about TEE security have been one impediment to their adoption. We therefore briefly discuss this issue. B.2.2 TEE Security Recent attacks against Intel SGX, the only commodity TEE with attestation capabil- ities, e.g., [211, 212], have cast doubt on the security of TEEs in practice. We believe that the technology will evolve, particularly with open source efforts emerging [152]. Mitigations: It is possible to deploy TEEs in ways that recognize their potential for compromise. One is to employ them for defense-in-depth, that is, for harden- ing systems. Town Crier may be viewed in this light: Trustworthy oracle operators should provide their users with confidentiality and integrity, but use of Town Crier strengthens this assurance. Similarly, TEEs can be deployed in ways that don’t rely on perfect security. Sealed-glass proofs [207], for instance, use TEEs for integrity, but not confidentiality (although recent side-channel attacks compromise both). Finally, it is possible to design TEE-based protocols with forward security, such that if a break becomes known: (1) Players can avoid use of the TEE and (2) The break does not retroactively impact previous protocol invocations. This approach would greatly limit the window of opportunity for adversaries to exploit TEE vulnerabilities. For example, in protocols where a TEE controls users’ funds, users might move those funds into addresses specifically for temporary, TEE-only use. In protocols where TEEs enforce confidentiality for long-lived data, frequent key rotation would achieve a similar goal. For example, a TEE could be used to implement the ConfSwitch adapter for confi- dential DeFi discussed in Appendix C.3. The TEE ingests (q, switch) encrypted under a public key pkTEE(t) for an epoch t lasting, e.g., a week, and generates the output s = switch(r). It then purges all the data it has processed. At the beginning of each new epoch, it deletes its old key, generates a new one, and publishes it to L or MAINCHAIN. (Such publication could be facilitated by an executable on L with a per-epoch initiator.) Players can additionally abort by agreement at any time. Of course, users have exposure in this model to zero-day, i.e., unpublished, attacks. There is a cost to using a zero-day attack, however, namely the risk of its exposure and invalidation through publication of a patch. B.2.3 Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) MPC is a term for generic computation on secret-shared values by a set of nodes. MPC enables realization of a “black box” functionality, i.e., computation of a function g on confidential inputs x1, . . . , xz such that players learn only g(x1, . . . , xz), and learn no information about the inputs to the function or intermediate computations. Inputs can be secret-shared, and also represented in a binding but confidential way on chain using a commitment scheme or encryption under'},\n",

Inputs can be secret-shared, and also represented in a binding but confidential way on chain using a commitment scheme or encryption under a secret-shared key. While quite flexible, and despite impressive recent advances, generic MPC-i.e., MPC that supports any function g-incurs very high computation and communication overhead by comparison with direct execution on a single node. For example, MPC using fairly state-of-the-art tools operating in an adversarial model with malicious players-such as EMP toolkit [218, 219]-require about 20 seconds of computation for a single AES evaluation for 14 nodes on a WAN. (Only 250ms of computation is online; the rest can be performed in a precomputation phase.) By comparison, an AES evaluation on a modern, consumer-grade CPU requires around 2µs [213]. In short, generic MPC is reasonably practical, but only for modest computations. Practical implementations have tended to focus on relatively modest computational tasks, such as auctions in Hyperledger Fabric [42]. Considerably more efficient protocols can be realized for certain functions g. One example is threshold signing, which is especially practical for BLS signatures [54]. 2PC, computation involving just two players can leverage special techniques (“garbled circuits”) that makes it considerably more efficient than computation involving n > 2 players. DECO [234], for example, uses both custom and generic 2PC techniques. Most MPC schemes and implementations have some important limitations. One is that a single player can abort the protocol and learn its output, while (anonymously) preventing other players from learning theirs’. This means a failure of robustness (ability to complete computation) but also fairness (in an MPC-specific sense), meaning that all players receive outputs or none does. Schemes that allow identification of aborting players (ID-MPC), e.g., [37] are one approach to this problem. But MPC protocols also generally make the strong assump- tion of network synchrony, without which they may experience both confidentiality and integrity failures. A reasonably practical robust version of MPC that operates in asynchronous networks is presented in [157]. Another limitation of most MPC protocols is their lack of public verifiability. This isn’t problematic in a model that assumes a quorum of honest players, but would be for the type of MAINCHAIN accountability discussed in Section 7.3 and Section 8.3. To ensure correct MPC outputs in the case of a failure in a majority of nodes requires use of publicly verifiable variants such as [37] with a public bulletin board-necessarily MAINCHAIN in a majority-dishonest model-and is thus not terribly practical. In summary, we expect that DONs will support MPC for specialized computations, such as threshold signing and DECO, early in their development. We will track devel- opments in the fast-moving field of MPC to determine where support for generic MPC may be appropriate. B.3 Storage Data sent to blockchains can play a multifarious role. It may be consumed immediately by contracts. It can alternatively be placed on chain for fast future access by contracts or for purposes not related to contract execution, such as archival storage facilitating the audit of off-chain systems. The quantities of data required for these last two purposes greatly exceeds that consumed by contracts today, as well as the data-storage capacity of most permissionless'},\n",

The quantities of data required for these last two purposes greatly exceeds that consumed by contracts today, as well as the data-storage capacity of most permissionless blockchains. We envision DONs accommodating two forms of storage. The first is on-ledger storage, achieved by inclusion within a DON’s ledger. The second option, particularly attractive for bulk storage, is off-ledger storage. Off-ledger storage may involve the use of off-chain systems that are innately de- centralized, such as Filecoin [188], IPFS [40], Storj [226], or Sia [215]. Filecoin has a built-in protocol called Proof of Replication (PoReps) [74, 112, 111, 188, 199], designed to ensure storage of multiple copies of a file F (and prevent miners from gaming the consensus protocol). The other three can only achieve this property by having an end user encrypt F multiple times under different keys, creating distinct correspond- ing ciphertexts ˜F1, ˜F2, ˜F3. A DON can perform such encryption on behalf of a user, permitting proof of replication without native support in a target storage protocol. Where compatible with users’ desired trust models, it is also possible to use existing systems, such as conventional cloud storage providers. Replication across such services is possible for robustness [57] and complementary to and composable with decentralized storage services. Confidentiality: DONs include the ability for O to store data encrypted under a secret-shared key. They can perform confidentiality-preserving computation over such data, as discussed above in Appendix B.2. B.4 Resource Pricing Accurate charging of users for resource use on blockchains remains a perennial chal- lenge. Mispriced resources do not merely carry the risk of discouraging important ap- plications within an ecosystem. They also constitute a security risk, as they can enable denial-of-service attacks [184] and more subtle attacks such as drainage of funds [222]. Resource pricing of executable logic in a DON is a somewhat easier problem, as DON nodes control resource usage and can apply whatever pricing strategies they deem appropriate. Possible approaches include market-driven pricing, gas metering `a la Ethereum, which is supported in EVM and WASM [3], and language-driven approaches such as non-Turing-complete languages [131]-potentially along with bounded code sizes. Pricing of adapters, however, will certainly require application-specific pricing strategies, as adapters access external resources, e.g., cloud storage, whose cost is DON-independent. C Adapter Examples In this appendix, we give a few examples of adapters, to illustrate both the wide variety that is desirable and achievable in practice and relevant notions of security and the techniques to enforce them. We use the notation Adapter(P, S) to denote an adapter that involves players in P and a set of data sources (or a single data source) S. We let →T denote an input / output to system T where there’s ambiguity. Otherwise inputs should be understood as read by an adapter from L and outputs as written to L. C.1 Oracle-Mediated Data-Source Access (MediatedReport) In some cases, certain nodes may have access to a data source S that the full set of nodes O does not. For example, some nodes may have API keys or other credentials that other nodes in O lack. Nodes with privileged access to a data source S can mediate access on'},\n",

C.1 Oracle-Mediated Data-Source Access (MediatedReport) In some cases, certain nodes may have access to a data source S that the full set of nodes O does not. For example, some nodes may have API keys or other credentials that other nodes in O lack. Nodes with privileged access to a data source S can mediate access on behalf of O using DECO (or Town Crier). Here we describe an adapter that does so with weak confidentiality. Technical approach: Using DECO, it is possible for a particular Oi to access S using confidential credentials and prove to another node Oj that it correctly relayed a report r from S, without revealing its credentials to Oj. This approach can be scaled of course to proofs across subsets of nodes. Adapter MediatedReport(O, S) Input: q Output: ⟨medreport : (q, r); Oi⟩ Security: • Availability: Oi must be available when invoked by players in O that lack access to S. • Integrity: r is correct under the cryptographic hardness assumptions of DECO and assuming at least k honest nodes in O. Example application: Suppose Oi submits a report r from data source S whose value is disputed by another node or nodes in O. This might occur, for instance, as part of the dispute mechanism in a staking protocol. The dispute might be arbitrated by invoking the full set of nodes in O. Some nodes in O, however, may lack access to S, which may be a specialized data source. Using DECO, it is possible for Oi to prove to nodes in O that its report r was correctly relayed from S, without other nodes having direct access to S. Variants and extensions: Town Crier offers an alternative way to achieve the same adapter. The credentials of Oi can be placed in Town Crier instances run by individual oracle nodes in O, with appropriate restrictions on their use [164]. It is also possible to extend MediatedReport so that O may call any node in O∗, a subset of nodes with access to S. It is also possible to generalize MediatedReport to involve nodes on MAINCHAIN. Such a variant can be helpful in protocols, e.g., staking or optimistic rollups, e.g. [141], that use on-chain arbitration of off-chain computation. C.2 Cross-Ledger Reports (XL-Report-Read) For many applications, it can be useful to exchange data across DONs. Here we describe a simple adapter to import a basic report from a DON B to another DON A. For simplicity, we assume a unique report of the form ⟨report : (q, r)⟩on LB for any given q. Technical approach: As messages on a ledger LB are signed with respect to pkLB, they can easily be authenticated by the set of oracle nodes OA operating Decentralized Oracle Network A if they know pkLB. Adapter XL-Report-Read(OA, LB) Input: (q, pkLB) →LA, for query q and target DON public key pkLB Output: ⟨XLreport : (q, r); pkLB⟩→LA. Security: • Availability: At least one node in OA must have access to LB. • Integrity: r’s correctness depends upon an honest OB.

Example application: A DON A may determine that it has sufficient trust in DON B to treat its reports as trustworthy. In this case, it may be more cost-effective to import certain reports than to generate them independently. PKI support: The main challenge in securing report transfer between DONs is maintenance of a supporting public-key infrastructure (PKI), that is, a trustworthy, up-to-date mapping of public keys to DONs. To support this essential functionality in Chainlink, we plan to maintain smart-contract-based directories of Decentralized Oracle Networks and their public keys on all blockchains that Chainlink supports. Variants and extensions: Of course, many other possible cross-DON adapters are possible. For example, DON A may have permission in DON B to import confidential data from LB. In this case, the adapter would require participation from OB. As another example, DON A may have selective write permissions on DON B, in which case a cross-chain adapter for writing data would be possible. Other extensions are possible to handle multiple or ambiguous reports on LB. For example, XL-Report-Read could relay the message M = (q, ∗), z with the highest index z on LB at a given time t. C.3 Confidential Switch (ConfSwitch) Our previous two examples did not provide on-ledger confidentiality of q or r. We now describe one that does: ConfSwitch. This adapter reveals on chain only a function switch of an aggregate (medianized) report r, and is thus appropriate for price feeds. It provides on-ledger confidentiality for q and r, revealing only a function of the latter. It also enables recording of confidential data for an auditor (with public key pkaud). Such auditing may be important, as the details of transactions that use ConfSwitch are not visible on the ledger or main chain. The data made available to the auditor includes q, switch, and optional auxiliary data α. Technical approach: To provide confidentiality for q and switch (and optionally α), they are encrypted under the public keys of O and the auditor. O accumulates reports offledger and aggregates them into a report r, and outputs switch(r). Neither q nor any report data are written explicitly on L. Strong confidentiality: Strong confidentiality is achievable in ConfSwitch using DECO or Town Crier. In such a variant, players place on L the commitment c = comm(q, switch) to the query and switch. Either player can then use DECO or Town Crier to retrieve reports and prove in zero knowledge their correctness with respect to c. As DECO enables such proofs only for individual reports, an additional step would be required: The user would prove the correctness of ciphertexts on individual reports and then prove the correctness of a claimed output switch(r), i.e., correct medianization and application of switch to the reports.

Figure 19: Adapter ConfSwitch D Functional Signatures A functional (digital) signature scheme [59], like a conventional signature, has a master (private) key sk that permits signing of any message. Additionally, however, the master key can be used to create a signing key skF, for a function F, that permits signing of any value y in the range of F, i.e. such that F(x) = y for some input x. A simple way to realize this primitive, given in [59], is as follows (with slight modi- fication). A fresh key pair (sk′, pk′) is generated. To create the key skF for function F is computed as: skF = sk′, cert = Sigsk(pk′ ∥F) , where cert here may be viewed as a “certificate” stating that pk′ is a valid public key for a functional signature with function F and master public key pk. A signature on message y using skF, then, takes the form: Sig∗ skF (y) = (cert, Sigsk′(y), x). To verify Sig∗ skF (y), i.e., compute verify∗ Sig∗ skF (y) , a verifier checks that F(x) = y, and also checks the validity of cert and Sigsk′(y) in the obvious way. The value x (the “witness”) can in principle be large-as in the oracle-oriented use cases we consider. A straightforward remedy [59] that is computationally efficient for the verifier is to substitute for x a SNARK (or zk-SNARK for confidentiality)-a compact proof (argument) of the existence of x. Functional signatures are conceptually straightforward, as are their basic construc- tions. But they provide a useful framework for reasoning about combining source data in oracle networks. D.1 Functional Signatures for Combining Data Returning to Example 4, we can see how a functional signature might be applied to create a proof σ that a value v was correctly computed from the value-signature set pair (V, Σ). Let (ski, pki) denote the signing key pair for data source Si in S = {S1, S2, . . . , SnS}. Suppose pk is a public key for S whose corresponding private key is shared in a threshold manner among data sources; for simplicity, assume ski is Si’s share of sk. We can then define a functional signature that medianizes a set of nS validly signed values as follows: F(V, Σ) = ( median(V ) if ∀i ∈{1 . . . nS}, verify(pki, σi, vi) = true ⊥ otherwise. ) A functional signature scheme with master key sk, then, can be used to transmit a correctly computed median value v to SC. The oracle network computes σ∗= Sig∗ skF (v), and sends it to SC, which verifies it by computing verify∗(σ∗, pk, v). Of course, to improve robustness to data source failures, F can be relaxed to medi- anize a subset of at least kS validly signed values for some threshold kS ≤nS, i.e., to accept valid signatures from a quorum of sources, as we do in our example constructions below.

D.2 Discretized Functional Signatures Computing σ∗using a SNARK-based function-signature construction is a computa- tionally intensive task that may be incompatible with high performance DON ap- plications. We therefore propose a relaxed variant we call discretized functional sig- natures, the key idea of which is to place a grid over the space of possible signed values, and constrain the values to that grid. For example if the required answer is a single scalar, the grid could be all the integer multiples of some grid size a ∈R+, aZ = {. . . , −3a, −2a, −a, 0, a, 2a, 3a, . . .}. Then a valid signed value is a representation of some az for z ∈Z plus a valid signature over az. The value az need not be the precise answer F(V, Σ), but will be close to it. To formalize this, in addition to the predicate function F from Appendix D.1, the specifi- cation of a discretized functional signature has an additional pair of parameters (δ, δ′), corresponding to how coarse/fine the constraining grid is. They are as follows: • The parameter δ bounds permitted deviation from the correct output of F. In- formally,21 given a pair (V, Σ), we require that it be infeasible for an adversarial signer (the DON, for our purposes) to generate a signature σ∗that deviates from the correct output of F(V, Σ) by more than δ, i.e., such that: verify∗(σ∗, pk, v) ^ (|F(V, Σ) −v| > δ) . • The parameter δ′ characterizes how precisely some quorum of values in V must match, for a feasible signature to be guaranteed. I.e., a functional signature σ∗ can always be constructed, given kS signers {Szi}kS i=1 with observations {vzi} such that |vzi −vzj| ≤δ′ for all i, j. Thus, δ may loosely be viewed as a soundness parameter, while δ′ is a completeness parameter, in the sense that it specifies that signatures can always be constructed from observations v = (v1, . . . , vkS) by honest participants as long as v lies within δ′ of the diagonal in V kS-space, under the max norm, i.e. so the larger δ′ is, the larger the set of signable observation sets is. Recall our assumption that ski is a secret share of sk. In describing an example construction, we further assume that Sig is a non-interactive threshold signature, e.g., a BLS signature [54]. In an example below, we will use (kS, nS)-threshold signatures for some threshold kS ≤nS such that kS > 2 3nS. With this machinery, we can build efficient functional signatures for a variety of different message spaces. The idea, briefly, is for data sources collectively-but non- interactively-to compute partial (kS, nS)-threshold signatures on grid values azi ∈aZ in the neighborhood of their respective individual values vi. In this way, the data sources in S collectively constrain v, without explicitly computing it. If at least kS data sources emit values vi that are sufficiently close, their neighboring grid values will have a common element which they have all signed, collectively creating a threshold signature on a grid point within a δ-bounded neighborhood of a valid v = F(V, Σ).'},\n",

A signature Sig∗ sk(v) for v = az is simply a threshold signature on az ∈aZ. We illustrate by way of example, describing a construction for medianizing. It is convenient here to define a cell for aZ as an interval of values contained within a pair of successive grid points, i.e., [az, a(z + 1)]. Example 6 (Discretized functional signature for median). Suppose the value to be signed is a price quote (e.g., the USD price of ETH), and can thus be represented as a positive integer in Z+ (e.g., denominated in some fraction of US dollars such as cents). For the function F(V, Σ) that medianizes a set of at least kS signed source values, the following construction achieves (δ = a, δ′ = a) for any a ∈N. Let 21A more formal security definition would require application of the “discretized” property to the existential unforgeability under a chosen message attack (EUF-CMA) for threshold signatures, for which see, e.g. [118]. ι(vi) = a⌊vi/a⌋, ι′(vi) = ι(vi) + a, i.e., [ι(vi), ι′(vi)] is the highest cell in the grid aZ which contains vi. Each data source Si emits a signature σi of the following form: σi = (σ(1) i , σ(2) i , σ(3)) = Sigski ι(vi) , Sigski ι(vi) , Sigski vi A signature σi is valid if all the constituent signatures σ(j) i are valid, and the mes- sages in σ(1) i , σ(2) i are equal to ι(vi), ι′(vi), where vi is the message in σ(3) i .22 A functional signature Sig∗ sk(v) = F({vi}, {σi}) can be constructed from the signa- tures {σi}i if there is a common grid point v = az ∈aZ on which some sufficiently large subset of {σ(1) i , σ(2) i }i contains partial signatures. The scheme in Example 6 achieves δ = a and δ′ = a for the median function F(V, Σ) that medianizes a set of at least kS signed source values, as we will show in the following lemmas. Lemma 1. Given a valid discretized functional signature on v ∈aZ, constructed from kS partial signatures on v, n σi = (Sigski(ι(vi)), Sigski(ι′(vi)), Sigski(vi)) okS i=1 , it follows that each vi lies in [v −a, v + a]. Proof. Since {σi} can be used to construct a functional signature on v, we must have v ∈{ι(vi), ι′(vi)} for each i. Thus one of the following is true: v = ι(vi) = a⌊vi/a⌋ =⇒vi ∈[v, v + a] v = ι′(vi) = a⌊vi/a⌋+ a =⇒vi ∈[v −a, v] Therefore, vi ∈[v −a, v] ∪[v, v + a] = [v −a, v + a]. 22σ(3) i = Sigski(vi) is not necessary for the correctness of this construction, but including it avoids distracting questions about what the median of the observations is, when • a dishonest oracle Si could attest to arbitrary grid cell boundaries irrespective of its observed value vi, or even without having observed any value vi at all, or • an aggregator of the partial signatures could'},\n",

It requires the minor (but distracting) ontological gymnastics of reassigning inaccurately-reported/nonsensical/nonexistent values of V to arbitrary integers. Lemma 2. Let {vi}m i=1 be a set of observations, and let I ⊂{1, . . . , m} be a subset of in- dices which constitute a majority. The median of {vi} lies in [min({vi}i∈I), max({vi}i∈I)]. Proof. Without loss of generality, assume the observations v1, . . . , vm are sorted. The subsequence arg min i∈I vi, . . . , arg max i∈I vi is longer than m 2 , since |I| > m 2 . Therefore, the midpoint(s)23 of the sequence 1, . . . , m lie(s) in subsequence, and thus the median lies in [min({vi}i∈I), max({vi}i∈I)]. Lemma 3. Given a valid discretized functional signature on v ∈aZ, from a set of nS signers {Si}, more than two thirds of which are honest, and a signature threshold kS > 2 3nS, the true median lies in [v −a, v + a]. Proof. By lemma 1, all the vi’s used by honest signers lie in [v −a, v + a]. While dishonest signers could have signed v on the basis of any observation (or even no observation), the honest participants form a majority of the signers, so by lemma 2 the median observation lies between two honest values in [v −a, v + a], and therefore itself lies in [v −a, v + a]. (The honest signers form a majority because at least kS > 2 3nS signed, but the number of dishonest participants in the signing group is assumed to be less than 1 3nS = 1 2 × 2 3nS < kS 2 .) Lemma 4. The discretized functional signature scheme in Example 6 achieves δ = a for the medianization function. Proof. By lemma 3, the true median lies in [v −a, v + a]. All points in this interval are less than a units from v, so the distance from v to the true median is less than a. I.e., the condition from the definition of δ which we desire to be infeasible, verify∗(σ∗, pk, v) ^ (|F(V, Σ) −v| > δ) . is indeed infeasible, for δ = a. Lemma 5.

I.e., given a quorum of at least kS signers Q = {Si} with observations |vi −vj| < a for Si, Sj ∈Q, a valid discretized functional signature can be constructed from their signatures {σi = (Sigski(ι(vi)), Sigski(ι′(vi)), Sigski(vi))} Proof.

Let I = [min({vi}i), max({vi}i)] be the smallest interval containing {vi}i. Since the length of I, | max({vi}i) −min({vi}i)|, is a difference between two elements of {vi} it is less than a. Thus I contains at most one point of aZ. If it contains one, say v, then v ∈{ι(vi), ι′(vi)} for all I, because each vi lies in either the cell below or the cell above v. Therefore a functional signature on v can be constructed from the σi’s. If it does not, it lies entirely within one cell of aZ, and {ι(vi), ι′(vi)} will be the same for all i, so a functional signature can be constructed on either boundary value. 23There are two midpoints if m is even, m 2 and m 2 + 1, and one midpoint if m is odd, m 2 + 1. The technique in Example 6 can be viewed as a means of reducing proximity testing to equality testing by discretizing values within a lattice. Greater resilience to variance (in the sense of larger δ′) can be achieved if participants send signatures over a larger set of grid points in the neighborhood of their observed vi’s. Enriching the discretized functional signature: As described here, a signature Sig∗ sk(v) is on a grid point v ∈aZ, and v will be close to but not necessary equal to the median vmed computed over a set of at least kS node-supplied values. It is possible, however, for a DON also to include vmed in its signed message. If vmed is computed by the DON, then it is a trustworthy value assuming the DON is functioning correctly. In some cases, contracts may wish to consume vmed if |v −vmed| ≤a, use v as assurance against gross inaccuracy of vmed. E Prospective Bribery One class of adversarial behavior we expressly designed our proposed staking mech- anisms to protect against is what we call prospective bribery. This novel attack is a generalization of the bribery attacks described in [166]. Prospective bribes are feasi- ble in and can impact the security of proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, and permissioned systems. In proof-of-work and proof-of-stake blockchains, a prospective briber commits to paying the creator of a future block a specified bribe given that the future block meets some specified condition. For example, a briber could post a bribe to ensure that a future block does not include a specific transaction, or includes a specified ordering. We use the term prospective because the briber actually does not know which node will be chosen to lead the protocol in the relevant round. Still, the bribe can be successful as long as the candidates for that leadership role are aware of the bribe. To grasp the impact of prospective bribery in the context of staking, consider a staking mechanism for an oracle network in which there is a pool of n oracles, and in each round a node is selected at random-using fresh randomness-to unilaterally report the next value. It may appear that this strategy is naturally resistant to bribery attack, as a briber might have no way to determine ahead'},\n",

It may appear that this strategy is naturally resistant to bribery attack, as a briber might have no way to determine ahead of time which node to bribe. However a briber can offer a guaranteed bribe to whichever node is selected as leader of the target block, promising a payment if and only if the block returns false (to use the language of Section 9). A briber can guarantee payment of a prospective bribe using a smart contract analogous to those shown in [166]. F Random vs. Committee-Based Oracle Selection It is possible to operate an oracle network in a permissionless or quasi-permissionless way, selecting a random subcommittee ˜O ⊂O producing a given report r or sequence of reports. An ostensible benefit of this approach is its resistance to attacks that corrupt nodes, whether technical or bribery-based. Provided that ˜O isn’t known in advance, an adversary must in principle control close to a majority of O, rather than just ˜O, in order to subvert r with high probability for sufficiently large n. This observation underlies many hybrid consensus protocols, e.g., [120, 182] as well as some oracle protocols, e.g., [25]. We believe, however, that in many applications, it will be beneficial for relying parties to select stable oracle nodes (or committees), for several reasons: • Non-uniform corruption: Rational nodes’ reliability is a function of incentives that reflect factors beyond their staked assets, such as potential future revenue, reputation, and so forth, as discussed in Section 9. Users may prefer to rely on nodes they assess as being highly trustworthy, rather than randomly selected nodes. Even as compared with stake-weighted randomized selection, this choice can result in selection of a more trustworthy committee, i.e., one less likely to be corrupted. • Corruption thresholds: A related issue is the fact that unless n and k are quite large or the fraction of adversarial nodes in O is quite low, the probability of a randomly selected subset ˜O having a high proportion of corrupted nodes at some time can be quite high. For example, suppose that n = 100, f = 10, i.e., only 10% of nodes are corrupted, and a subcommittee of size | ˜O| = 10 is selected uniformly at random. The probability of a majority corrupt subcommittee being selected is ≈0.000009. Even in a system with low throughput, handling, e.g., one request a second, if a new committee is selected for each job, a corrupt committee will surface on expectation in just over a day. For this reason, given adversarial fraction f/n = 1/4, with its proposed security parameters, the random-committee-selection scheme in [41] requires a committee size of 26,091! We consequently believe that random selection is not sufficient to ensure the trustworthiness of O over time, an issue that is particularly pertinent given the next point we highlight. • Confidentiality: In order to access data stored with oracle nodes in a threshold manner, a user must interact with the nodes that hold skL. It is possible to hand offskL across committees of oracle nodes with dynamically changing member- ship. Apart from the potentially large increase in communication cost, frequent changes could'},\n",

Apart from the potentially large increase in communication cost, frequent changes could be problematic because they result in an elevated probability of the committee having f ≥k corruptions at some time, resulting in a catastrophic failure, as explained above. • Prospective bribery: As noted in Section 9, an adversary can offer a bribe to nodes in a committee in advance of committee selection by making the bribe contingent on a node’s selection. That is, a node can prove that it was selected and generated a desired report in order to claim a bounty. Smart contracts can in fact facilitate such malfeasance using techniques like those in [165]. • Innovation: Oracle providers may choose to differentiate themselves based on performance, accuracy, or special features, such as enhanced confidentiality or ac- cess to proprietary data. Allowing users to choose providers, rather than drawing providers from a pool with homogeneous capabilities, can help promote innova- tion. • Customization: Different users may have different preferences in terms of trade- offs among reliability, performance, and cost tradeoffs, and should be able to express these preferences in terms of their selection of providers.'},\n",

So far, the \"bitcoin\" as a currency unit has taken up the bulk of the public attention, both in terms of the political aspects of a currency without a central bank and its extreme upward and downward volatility in price. However, there is also another, equally important, part to Satoshi\\'s grand experiment: the concept of a proof of work-based blockchain to allow for public agreement on the order of transactions. Bitcoin as an application can be described as a first-to-file system: if one entity has 50 BTC, and simultaneously sends the same 50 BTC to A and to B, only the transaction that gets confirmed first will process. There is no intrinsic way of determining from two transactions which came earlier, and for decades this stymied the development of decentralized digital currency. Satoshi\\'s blockchain was the first credible decentralized solution. And now, attention is rapidly starting to shift toward this second part of Bitcoin\\'s technology, and how the blockchain concept can be used for more than just money. Commonly cited applications include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments (\"colored coins\"), the ownership of an underlying physical device (\"smart property\"), non-fungible assets such as domain names (\"Namecoin\") as well as more advanced applications such as decentralized exchange, financial derivatives, peer-to-peer gambling and on-blockchain identity and reputation systems. Another important area of inquiry is \"smart contracts\" - systems which automatically move digital assets according to arbitrary pre-specified rules. For example, one might have a treasury contract of the form \"A can withdraw up to X currency units per day, B can withdraw up to Y per day, A and B together can withdraw anything, and A can shut off B\\'s ability to withdraw\". The logical extension of this is decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) - long-term smart contracts that contain the assets and encode the bylaws of an entire organization. What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create \"contracts\" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code. ethereum.org Ethereum: A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform.

The anonymous e-cash protocols of the 1980s and the 1990s, mostly reliant on a cryptographic primitive known as Chaumian blinding, provided a currency with a high degree of privacy, but the protocols largely failed to gain traction because of their reliance on a centralized intermediary. In 1998, Wei Dai\\'s b-money became the first proposal to introduce the idea of creating money through solving computational puzzles as well as decentralized consensus, but the proposal was scant on details as to how decentralized consensus could actually be implemented. In 2005, Hal Finney introduced a concept of \"reusable proofs of work\", a system which uses ideas from b-money together with Adam Back\\'s computationally difficult Hashcash puzzles to create a concept for a cryptocurrency, but once again fell short of the ideal by relying on trusted computing as a backend. Because currency is a first-to-file application, where the order of transactions is often of critical importance, decentralized currencies require a solution to decentralized consensus. The main roadblock that all pre-Bitcoin currency protocols faced is the fact that, while there had been plenty of research on creating secure Byzantine-fault-tolerant multiparty consensus systems for many years, all of the protocols described were solving only half of the problem. The protocols assumed that all participants in the system were known, and produced security margins of the form \"if N parties participate, then the system can tolerate up to N/4 malicious actors\". The problem is, however, that in an anonymous setting such security margins are vulnerable to sybil attacks, where a single attacker creates thousands of simulated nodes on a server or botnet and uses these nodes to unilaterally secure a majority share. The innovation provided by Satoshi is the idea of combining a very simple decentralized consensus protocol, based on nodes combining transactions into a \"block\" every ten minutes creating an ever-growing blockchain, with proof of work as a mechanism through which nodes gain the right to participate in the system. While nodes with a large amount of computational power do have proportionately greater influence, coming up with more computational power than the entire network combined is much harder than simulating a million nodes. Despite the Bitcoin blockchain model\\'s crudeness and simplicity, it has proven to be good enough, and would over the next five years become the bedrock of over two hundred currencies and protocols around the world. ethereum.org Bitcoin As A State Transition System From a technical standpoint, the Bitcoin ledger can be thought of as a state transition system, where there is a \"state\" consisting of the ownership status of all existing bitcoins and a \"state transition function\" that takes a state and a transaction and outputs a new state which is the result. In a standard banking system, for example, the state is a balance sheet, a transaction is a request to move $X from A to B, and the state transition function reduces the value in A\\'s account by $X and increases the value in B\\'s account by $X. If A\\'s account has less than $X in the first place, the state transition function returns an error. Hence, one can formally define: APPLY(S,TX) > S\\' or ERROR In the banking system defined above: APPLY({ Alice: $50, Bob: $50 },\"send'},\n",

A transaction contains one or more inputs, with each input containing a reference to an existing UTXO and a cryptographic signature produced by the private key associated with the owner\\'s address, and one or more outputs, with each output containing a new UTXO to be added to the state. ethereum.org The state transition function APPLY(S,TX) > S\\' can be defined roughly as follows: 1. For each input in TX: i. If the referenced UTXO is not in S, return an error. ii. If the provided signature does not match the owner of the UTXO, return an error. 2. If the sum of the denominations of all input UTXO is less than the sum of the denominations of all output UTXO, return an error. 3. Return S with all input UTXO removed and all output UTXO added. The first half of the first step prevents transaction senders from spending coins that do not exist, the second half of the first step prevents transaction senders from spending other people\\'s coins, and the second step enforces conservation of value. In order to use this for payment, the protocol is as follows. Suppose Alice wants to send 11.7 BTC to Bob. First, Alice will look for a set of available UTXO that she owns that totals up to at least 11.7 BTC. Realistically, Alice will not be able to get exactly 11.7 BTC; say that the smallest she can get is 6+4+2=12. She then creates a transaction with those three inputs and two outputs. The first output will be 11.7 BTC with Bob\\'s address as its owner, and the second output will be the remaining 0.3 BTC \"change\", with the owner being Alice herself. Mining If we had access to a trustworthy centralized service, this system would be trivial to implement; it could simply be coded exactly as described. However, with Bitcoin we are trying to build a decentralized currency system, so we will need to combine the state transition system with a consensus system in order to ensure that everyone agrees on the order of transactions. Bitcoin\\'s decentralized consensus process requires nodes in the network to continuously attempt to produce packages of transactions called \"blocks\". The network is intended to produce roughly one block every ten minutes, with each block containing a timestamp, a nonce, a reference to (ie. hash of) the ethereum.org previous block and a list of all of the transactions that have taken place since the previous block. Over time, this creates a persistent, ever-growing, \"blockchain\" that constantly updates to represent the latest state of the Bitcoin ledger. The'},\n",

Over time, this creates a persistent, ever-growing, \"blockchain\" that constantly updates to represent the latest state of the Bitcoin ledger. The algorithm for checking if a block is valid, expressed in this paradigm, is as follows: 1. Check if the previous block referenced by the block exists and is valid 2. Check that the timestamp of the block is greater than that of the previous block[2] and less than 2 hours into the future. 3. Check that the proof of work on the block is valid. 4. Let S[0] be the state at the end of the previous block. 5. Suppose TX is the block\\'s transaction list with n transactions. For all i in 0...n-1, setS[i+1] = APPLY(S[i],TX[i]) If any application returns an error, exit and return false. 6. Return true, and register S[n] as the state at the end of this block Essentially, each transaction in the block must provide a state transition that is valid. Note that the state is not encoded in the block in any way; it is purely an abstraction to be remembered by the validating node and can only be (securely) computed for any block by starting from the genesis state and sequentially applying every transaction in every block. Additionally, note that the order in which the miner includes transactions into the block matters; if there are two transactions A and B in a block such that B spends a UTXO created by A, then the block will be valid if A comes before B but not otherwise. The interesting part of the block validation algorithm is the concept of \"proof of work\": the condition is that the SHA256 hash of every block, treated as a 256-bit number, must be less than a dynamically adjusted target, which as of the time of this writing is approximately 2190. The purpose of this is to make block creation computationally \"hard\", thereby preventing sybil attackers from remaking the entire blockchain in their favor. Because SHA256 is designed to be a completely unpredictable pseudorandom function, the only way to create a valid block is simply trial and error, repeatedly incrementing the nonce and seeing if the new hash matches. At the current target of 2192, this means an average of 264 tries; in general, the target is recalibrated by the network every 2016 blocks so that on average a new block is produced by some node in the network every ten minutes. In order to compensate miners for this computational work, the miner of every block is entitled to include a transaction giving themselves 25 BTC out of nowhere. Additionally, if any transaction has a higher total denomination in its inputs than in its outputs, the difference also goes to the miner as a \"transaction fee\". Incidentally, this is also the only mechanism by which BTC are issued; the genesis state contained no coins at all. ethereum.org In order to better understand the purpose of mining, let us examine what happens in the event of a malicious attacker.

Since Bitcoin\\'s underlying cryptography is known to be secure, the attacker will target the one part of the Bitcoin system that is not protected by cryptography directly: the order of transactions. The attacker\\'s strategy is simple: 1. Send 100 BTC to a merchant in exchange for some product (preferably a rapid-delivery digital good) 2. Wait for the delivery of the product 3. Produce another transaction sending the same 100 BTC to himself 4. Try to convince the network that his transaction to himself was the one that came first. Once step (1) has taken place, after a few minutes some miner will include the transaction in a block, say block number 270000. After about one hour, five more blocks will have been added to the chain after that block, with each of those blocks indirectly pointing to the transaction and thus \"confirming\" it. At this point, the merchant will accept the payment as finalized and deliver the product; since we are assuming this is a digital good, delivery is instant. Now, the attacker creates another transaction sending the 100 BTC to himself. If the attacker simply releases it into the wild, the transaction will not be processed; miners will attempt to run APPLY(S,TX) and notice that TX consumes a UTXO which is no longer in the state. So instead, the attacker creates a \"fork\" of the blockchain, starting by mining another version of block 270000 pointing to the same block 269999 as a parent but with the new transaction in place of the old one. Because the block data is different, this requires redoing the proof of work. Furthermore, the attacker\\'s new version of block 270000 has a different hash, so the original blocks 270001 to 270005 do not \"point\" to it; thus, the original chain and the attacker\\'s new chain are completely separate. The rule is that in a fork the longest blockchain (ie. the one backed by the largest quantity of proof of work) is taken to be the truth, and so legitimate miners will work on the 270005 chain while the attacker alone is working on the 270000 chain. In order for the attacker to make his blockchain the longest, he would need to have more computational power than the rest of the network combined in order to catch up (hence, \"51% attack\"). ethereum.org Merkle Trees Left: it suffices to present only a small number of nodes in a Merkle tree to give a proof of the validity of a branch. Right: any attempt to change any part of the Merkle tree will eventually lead to an inconsistency somewhere up the chain. An important scalability feature of Bitcoin is that the block is stored in a multi-level data structure. The \"hash\" of a block is actually only the hash of the block header, a roughly 200-byte piece of data that contains the timestamp, nonce, previous block hash and the root hash of a data structure called the Merkle tree storing all transactions in the block.

A Merkle tree is a type of binary tree, composed of a set of nodes with a large number of leaf nodes at the bottom of the tree containing the underlying data, a set of intermediate nodes where each node is the hash of its two children, and finally a single root node, also formed from the hash of its two children, representing the \"top\" of the tree. The purpose of the Merkle tree is to allow the data in a block to be delivered piecemeal: a node can download only the header of a block from one source, the small part of the tree relevant to them from ethereum.org another source, and still be assured that all of the data is correct. The reason why this works is that hashes propagate upward: if a malicious user attempts to swap in a fake transaction into the bottom of a Merkle tree, this change will cause a change in the node above, and then a change in the node above that, finally changing the root of the tree and therefore the hash of the block, causing the protocol to register it as a completely different block (almost certainly with an invalid proof of work). The Merkle tree protocol is arguably essential to long-term sustainability. A \"full node\" in the Bitcoin network, one that stores and processes the entirety of every block, takes up about 15 GB of disk space in the Bitcoin network as of April 2014, and is growing by over a gigabyte per month. Currently, this is viable for some desktop computers and not phones, and later on in the future only businesses and hobbyists will be able to participate. A protocol known as \"simplified payment verification\" (SPV) allows for another class of nodes to exist, called \"light nodes\", which download the block headers, verify the proof of work on the block headers, and then download only the \"branches\" associated with transactions that are relevant to them. This allows light nodes to determine with a strong guarantee of security what the status of any Bitcoin transaction, and their current balance, is while downloading only a very small portion of the entire blockchain. Alternative Blockchain Applications The idea of taking the underlying blockchain idea and applying it to other concepts also has a long history. In 2005, Nick Szabo came out with the concept of \"secure property titles with owner authority\", a document describing how \"new advances in replicated database technology\" will allow for a blockchain-based system for storing a registry of who owns what land, creating an elaborate framework including concepts such as homesteading, adverse possession and Georgian land tax. However, there was unfortunately no effective replicated database system available at the time, and so the protocol was never implemented in practice. After 2009, however, once Bitcoin\\'s decentralized consensus was developed a number of alternative applications rapidly began to emerge: ● Namecoin - created in 2010, Namecoin is best described as a decentralized name registration database.

In decentralized protocols like Tor, Bitcoin and BitMessage, there needs to be some way of identifying accounts so that other people can interact with them, but in all existing solutions the only kind of identifier available is a pseudorandom hash like1LW79wp5ZBqaHW1jL5TCiBCrhQYtHagUWy. Ideally, one would like to be able to have an account with a name like \"george\". However, the problem is that if one person can create an account named \"george\" then someone else can use the same process to register \"george\" for themselves as well and impersonate them. The only solution is a first-to-file paradigm, where the first registrant succeeds and the second fails - a problem perfectly suited for the Bitcoin consensus protocol. Namecoin is the oldest, and most successful, implementation of a name registration system using such an idea. ● Colored coins - the purpose of colored coins is to serve as a protocol to allow people to create their own digital currencies - or, in the important trivial case of a currency with one unit, digital tokens, ethereum.org on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the colored coins protocol, one \"issues\" a new currency by publicly assigning a color to a specific Bitcoin UTXO, and the protocol recursively defines the color of other UTXO to be the same as the color of the inputs that the transaction creating them spent (some special rules apply in the case of mixed-color inputs). This allows users to maintain wallets containing only UTXO of a specific color and send them around much like regular bitcoins, backtracking through the blockchain to determine the color of any UTXO that they receive. ● Metacoins - the idea behind a metacoin is to have a protocol that lives on top of Bitcoin, using Bitcoin transactions to store metacoin transactions but having a different state transition function, APPLY\\'. Because the metacoin protocol cannot prevent invalid metacoin transactions from appearing in the Bitcoin blockchain, a rule is added that if APPLY\\'(S,TX) returns an error, the protocol defaults to APPLY\\'(S,TX) = S. This provides an easy mechanism for creating an arbitrary cryptocurrency protocol, potentially with advanced features that cannot be implemented inside of Bitcoin itself, but with a very low development cost since the complexities of mining and networking are already handled by the Bitcoin protocol. Thus, in general, there are two approaches toward building a consensus protocol: building an independent network, and building a protocol on top of Bitcoin. The former approach, while reasonably successful in the case of applications like Namecoin, is difficult to implement; each individual implementation needs to bootstrap an independent blockchain, as well as building and testing all of the necessary state transition and networking code. Additionally, we predict that the set of applications for decentralized consensus technology will follow a power law distribution where the vast majority of applications would be too small to warrant their own blockchain, and we note that there exist large classes of decentralized applications, particularly decentralized autonomous organizations, that need to interact with each other.

The Bitcoin-based approach, on the other hand, has the flaw that it does not inherit the simplified payment verification features of Bitcoin. SPV works for Bitcoin because it can use blockchain depth as a proxy for validity; at some point, once the ancestors of a transaction go far enough back, it is safe to say that they were legitimately part of the state. Blockchain-based meta-protocols, on the other hand, cannot force the blockchain not to include transactions that are not valid within the context of their own protocols. Hence, a fully secure SPV meta-protocol implementation would need to backward scan all the way to the beginning of the Bitcoin blockchain to determine whether or not certain transactions are valid. Currently, all \"light\" implementations of Bitcoin-based meta-protocols rely on a trusted server to provide the data, arguably a highly suboptimal result especially when one of the primary purposes of a cryptocurrency is to eliminate the need for trust. Scripting Even without any extensions, the Bitcoin protocol actually does facilitate a weak version of a concept of \"smart contracts\". UTXO in Bitcoin can be owned not just by a public key, but also by a more complicated script expressed in a simple stack-based programming language. In this paradigm, a transaction spending that UTXO must provide data that satisfies the script. Indeed, even the basic public key ownership mechanism is ethereum.org implemented via a script: the script takes an elliptic curve signature as input, verifies it against the transaction and the address that owns the UTXO, and returns 1 if the verification is successful and 0 otherwise. Other, more complicated, scripts exist for various additional use cases. For example, one can construct a script that requires signatures from two out of a given three private keys to validate (\"multisig\"), a setup useful for corporate accounts, secure savings accounts and some merchant escrow situations. Scripts can also be used to pay bounties for solutions to computational problems, and one can even construct a script that says something like \"this Bitcoin UTXO is yours if you can provide an SPV proof that you sent a Dogecoin transaction of this denomination to me\", essentially allowing decentralized cross-cryptocurrency exchange. However, the scripting language as implemented in Bitcoin has several important limitations: ● Lack of Turing-completeness - that is to say, while there is a large subset of computation that the Bitcoin scripting language supports, it does not nearly support everything. The main category that is missing is loops. This is done to avoid infinite loops during transaction verification; theoretically it is a surmountable obstacle for script programmers, since any loop can be simulated by simply repeating the underlying code many times with an if statement, but it does lead to scripts that are very space-inefficient. For example, implementing an alternative elliptic curve signature algorithm would likely require 256 repeated multiplication rounds all individually included in the code. ● Value-blindness - there is no way for a UTXO script to provide fine-grained control over the amount that can be withdrawn. For example, one powerful use case of an oracle contract would be a hedging contract, where A and B put in $1000 worth of BTC and after'},\n",

For example, one powerful use case of an oracle contract would be a hedging contract, where A and B put in $1000 worth of BTC and after 30 days the script sends $1000 worth of BTC to A and the rest to B. This would require an oracle to determine the value of 1 BTC in USD, but even then it is a massive improvement in terms of trust and infrastructure requirement over the fully centralized solutions that are available now. However, because UTXO are all-or-nothing, the only way to achieve this is through the very inefficient hack of having many UTXO of varying denominations (eg. one UTXO of 2k for every k up to 30) and having the oracle pick which UTXO to send to A and which to B. ● Lack of state - UTXO can either be spent or unspent; there is no opportunity for multi-stage contracts or scripts which keep any other internal state beyond that. This makes it hard to make multi-stage options contracts, decentralized exchange offers or two-stage cryptographic commitment protocols (necessary for secure computational bounties). It also means that UTXO can only be used to build simple, one-off contracts and not more complex \"stateful\" contracts such as decentralized organizations, and makes meta-protocols difficult to implement. Binary state combined with value-blindness also mean that another important application, withdrawal limits, is impossible. ● Blockchain-blindness - UTXO are blind to blockchain data such as the nonce and previous hash. This severely limits applications in gambling, and several other categories, by depriving the scripting language of a potentially valuable source of randomness. ethereum.org Thus, we see three approaches to building advanced applications on top of cryptocurrency: building a new blockchain, using scripting on top of Bitcoin, and building a meta-protocol on top of Bitcoin. Building a new blockchain allows for unlimited freedom in building a feature set, but at the cost of development time and bootstrapping effort. Using scripting is easy to implement and standardize, but is very limited in its capabilities, and meta-protocols, while easy, suffer from faults in scalability. With Ethereum, we intend to build a generalized framework that can provide the advantages of all three paradigms at the same time. Ethereum The intent of Ethereum is to merge together and improve upon the concepts of scripting, altcoins and on-chain meta-protocols, and allow developers to create arbitrary consensus-based applications that have the scalability, standardization, feature-completeness, ease of development and interoperability offered by these different paradigms all at the same time. Ethereum does this by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer: a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions. A bare-bones version of Namecoin can be written in two lines of code, and other protocols like currencies and reputation systems can be built in under twenty. Smart contracts, cryptographic \"boxes\" that contain value and only unlock it if certain conditions are met, can also be built on top of our platform, with vastly more power than that offered by Bitcoin scripting because of the added'},\n",

Smart contracts, cryptographic \"boxes\" that contain value and only unlock it if certain conditions are met, can also be built on top of our platform, with vastly more power than that offered by Bitcoin scripting because of the added powers of Turing-completeness, value-awareness, blockchain-awareness and state. Ethereum Accounts In Ethereum, the state is made up of objects called \"accounts\", with each account having a 20-byte address and state transitions being direct transfers of value and information between accounts. An Ethereum account contains four fields: ● The nonce, a counter used to make sure each transaction can only be processed once ● The account\\'s current ether balance ● The account\\'s contract code, if present ● The account\\'s storage (empty by default) \"Ether\" is the main internal crypto-fuel of Ethereum, and is used to pay transaction fees. In general, there are two types of accounts: externally owned accounts, controlled by private keys, and contract accounts, controlled by their contract code. An externally owned account has no code, and one can send messages from an externally owned account by creating and signing a transaction; in a contract account, every time the ethereum.org contract account receives a message its code activates, allowing it to read and write to internal storage and send other messages or create contracts in turn. Messages and Transactions \"Messages\" in Ethereum are somewhat similar to “transactions” in Bitcoin, but with three important differences. First, an Ethereum message can be created either by an external entity or a contract, whereas a Bitcoin transaction can only be created externally. Second, there is an explicit option for Ethereum messages to contain data. Finally, the recipient of an Ethereum message, if it is a contract account, has the option to return a response; this means that Ethereum messages also encompass the concept of functions. The term \"transaction\" is used in Ethereum to refer to the signed data package that stores a message to be sent from an externally owned account. Transactions contain the recipient of the message, a signature identifying the sender, the amount of ether and the data to send, as well as two values called STARTGAS and GASPRICE. In order to prevent exponential blowup and infinite loops in code, each transaction is required to set a limit to how many computational steps of code execution it can spawn, including both the initial message and any additional messages that get spawned during execution. STARTGAS is this limit, and GASPRICE is the fee to pay to the miner per computational step. If transaction execution \"runs out of gas\", all state changes revert - except for the payment of the fees, and if transaction execution halts with some gas remaining then the remaining portion of the fees is refunded to the sender. There is also a separate transaction type, and corresponding message type, for creating a contract; the address of a contract is calculated based on the hash of the account nonce and transaction data. An important consequence of the message mechanism is the \"first class citizen\" property of Ethereum - the idea that contracts have equivalent powers to external accounts, including the ability to send message and create other contracts. This allows contracts to simultaneously serve many different roles: for example, one might'},\n",

This allows contracts to simultaneously serve many different roles: for example, one might have a member of a decentralized organization (a contract) be an escrow account (another contract) between an paranoid individual employing custom quantum-proof Lamport signatures (a third contract) and a co-signing entity which itself uses an account with five keys for security (a fourth contract). The strength of the Ethereum platform is that the decentralized organization and the escrow contract do not need to care about what kind of account each party to the contract is. ethereum.org Ethereum State Transition Function The Ethereum state transition function, APPLY(S,TX) -> S\\' can be defined as follows: 1. Check if the transaction is well-formed (ie. has the right number of values), the signature is valid, and the nonce matches the nonce in the sender\\'s account. If not, return an error. 2. Calculate the transaction fee as STARTGAS * GASPRICE, and determine the sending address from the signature. Subtract the fee from the sender\\'s account balance and increment the sender\\'s nonce. If there is not enough balance to spend, return an error. 3. Initialize GAS = STARTGAS, and take off a certain quantity of gas per byte to pay for the bytes in the transaction. 4. Transfer the transaction value from the sender\\'s account to the receiving account. If the receiving account does not yet exist, create it. If the receiving account is a contract, run the contract\\'s code either to completion or until the execution runs out of gas. 5. If the value transfer failed because the sender did not have enough money, or the code execution ran out of gas, revert all state changes except the payment of the fees, and add the fees to the miner\\'s account. 6. Otherwise, refund the fees for all remaining gas to the sender, and send the fees paid for gas consumed to the miner. ethereum.org For example, suppose that the contract\\'s code is: if !contract.storage[msg.data[0]]: contract.storage[msg.data[0]] = msg.data[1] Note that in reality the contract code is written in the low-level EVM code; this example is written in Serpent, our high-level language, for clarity, and can be compiled down to EVM code. Suppose that the contract\\'s storage starts off empty, and a transaction is sent with 10 ether value, 2000 gas, 0.001 ether gasprice, and two data fields: [ 2, \\'CHARLIE\\' ][3]. The process for the state transition function in this case is as follows: 1. Check that the transaction is valid and well formed. 2. Check that the transaction sender has at least 2000 * 0.001 = 2 ether. If it is, then subtract 2 ether from the sender\\'s account. 3. Initialize gas = 2000; assuming the transaction is 170 bytes long and the byte-fee is 5, subtract 850 so that there is 1150 gas left. 4. Subtract 10 more ether from the sender\\'s account, and add it to the contract\\'s account. 5. Run the code. In this case, this is simple: it checks if the contract\\'s storage at index 2 is used, notices that it is not, and so it sets the storage at index'},\n",

If there was no contract at the receiving end of the transaction, then the total transaction fee would simply be equal to the provided GASPRICE multiplied by the length of the transaction in bytes, and the data sent alongside the transaction would be irrelevant. Additionally, note that contract-initiated messages can assign a gas limit to the computation that they spawn, and if the sub-computation runs out of gas it gets reverted only to the point of the message call. Hence, just like transactions, contracts can secure their limited computational resources by setting strict limits on the sub-computations that they spawn. ethereum.org Code Execution The code in Ethereum contracts is written in a low-level, stack-based bytecode language, referred to as \"Ethereum virtual machine code\" or \"EVM code\". The code consists of a series of bytes, where each byte represents an operation. In general, code execution is an infinite loop that consists of repeatedly carrying out the operation at the current program counter (which begins at zero) and then incrementing the program counter by one, until the end of the code is reached or an error or STOP or RETURN instruction is detected. The operations have access to three types of space in which to store data: ● The stack, a last-in-first-out container to which 32-byte values can be pushed and popped ● Memory, an infinitely expandable byte array ● The contract\\'s long-term storage, a key/value store where keys and values are both 32 bytes. Unlike stack and memory, which reset after computation ends, storage persists for the long term. The code can also access the value, sender and data of the incoming message, as well as block header data, and the code can also return a byte array of data as an output. The formal execution model of EVM code is surprisingly simple. While the Ethereum virtual machine is running, its full computational state can be defined by the tuple (block_state, transaction, message, code, memory, stack, pc, gas), where block_state is the global state containing all accounts and includes balances and storage. Every round of execution, the current instruction is found by taking the pc-th byte of code, and each instruction has its own definition in terms of how it affects the tuple. For example, ADD pops two items off the stack and pushes their sum, reduces gas by 1 and increments pc by 1, and SSTORE pushes the top two items off the stack and inserts the second item into the contract\\'s storage at the index specified by the first item, as well as reducing gas by up to 200 and incrementing pc by 1.

The main difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin with regard to the blockchain architecture is that, unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum blocks contain a copy of both the transaction list and the most recent state. Aside from that, two other values, the block number and the difficulty, are also stored in the block. The block validation algorithm in Ethereum is as follows: 1. Check if the previous block referenced exists and is valid. 2. Check that the timestamp of the block is greater than that of the referenced previous block and less than 15 minutes into the future 3. Check that the block number, difficulty, transaction root, uncle root and gas limit (various low-level Ethereum-specific concepts) are valid. 4. Check that the proof of work on the block is valid. 5. Let S[0] be the STATE_ROOT of the previous block. 6. Let TX be the block\\'s transaction list, with n transactions. For all in in 0...n-1, setS[i+1] = APPLY(S[i],TX[i]). If any applications returns an error, or if the total gas consumed in the block up until this point exceeds the GASLIMIT, return an error. 7. Let S_FINAL be S[n], but adding the block reward paid to the miner. 8. Check if S_FINAL is the same as the STATE_ROOT. If it is, the block is valid; otherwise, it is not valid. ethereum.org The approach may seem highly inefficient at first glance, because it needs to store the entire state with each block, but in reality efficiency should be comparable to that of Bitcoin. The reason is that the state is stored in the tree structure, and after every block only a small part of the tree needs to be changed. Thus, in general, between two adjacent blocks the vast majority of the tree should be the same, and therefore the data can be stored once and referenced twice using pointers (ie. hashes of subtrees). A special kind of tree known as a \"Patricia tree\" is used to accomplish this, including a modification to the Merkle tree concept that allows for nodes to be inserted and deleted, and not just changed, efficiently. Additionally, because all of the state information is part of the last block, there is no need to store the entire blockchain history - a strategy which, if it could be applied to Bitcoin, can be calculated to provide 5-20x savings in space. Applications In general, there are three types of applications on top of Ethereum. The first category is financial applications, providing users with more powerful ways of managing and entering into contracts using their money. This includes sub-currencies, financial derivatives, hedging contracts, savings wallets, wills, and ultimately even some classes of full-scale employment contracts. The second category is semi-financial applications, where money is involved but there is also a heavy non-monetary side to what is being done; a perfect example is self-enforcing bounties for solutions to computational problems.'},\n",

Finally, there are applications such as online voting and decentralized governance that are not financial at all. Token Systems On-blockchain token systems have many applications ranging from sub-currencies representing assets such as USD or gold to company stocks, individual tokens representing smart property, secure unforgeable coupons, and even token systems with no ties to conventional value at all, used as point systems for incentivization. Token systems are surprisingly easy to implement in Ethereum. The key point to understand is that all a currency, or token systen, fundamentally is is a database with one operation: subtract X units from A and give X units to B, with the proviso that (i) X had at least X units before the transaction and (2) the transaction is approved by A. All that it takes to implement a token system is to implement this logic into a contract. ethereum.org The basic code for implementing a token system in Serpent looks as follows: from = msg.sender to = msg.data[0] value = msg.data[1] if contract.storage[from] >= value: contract.storage[from] = contract.storage[from] value contract.storage[to] = contract.storage[to] + value This is essentially a literal implementation of the \"banking system\" state transition function described further above in this document. A few extra lines of code need to be added to provide for the initial step of distributing the currency units in the first place and a few other edge cases, and ideally a function would be added to let other contracts query for the balance of an address. But that\\'s all there is to it. Theoretically, Ethereum-based token systems acting as sub-currencies can potentially include another important feature that on-chain Bitcoin-based meta-currencies lack: the ability to pay transaction fees directly in that currency. The way this would be implemented is that the contract would maintain an ether balance with which it would refund ether used to pay fees to the sender, and it would refill this balance by collecting the internal currency units that it takes in fees and reselling them in a constant running auction. Users would thus need to \"activate\" their accounts with ether, but once the ether is there it would be reusable because the contract would refund it each time. Financial derivatives and Stable-Value Currencies Financial derivatives are the most common application of a \"smart contract\", and one of the simplest to implement in code. The main challenge in implementing financial contracts is that the majority of them require reference to an external price ticker; for example, a very desirable application is a smart contract that hedges against the volatility of ether (or another cryptocurrency) with respect to the US dollar, but doing this requires the contract to know what the value of ETH/USD is. The simplest way to do this is through a \"data feed\" contract maintained by a specific party (eg. NASDAQ) designed so that that party has the ability to update the contract as needed, and providing an interface that allows other contracts to send a message to that contract and get back'},\n",

NASDAQ) designed so that that party has the ability to update the contract as needed, and providing an interface that allows other contracts to send a message to that contract and get back a response that provides the price. Given that critical ingredient, the hedging contract would look as follows: 1. Wait for party A to input 1000 ether. 2. Wait for party B to input 1000 ether. 3. Record the USD value of 1000 ether, calculated by querying the data feed contract, in storage, say this is $x. 4. After 30 days, allow A or B to \"ping\" the contract in order to send $x worth of ether (calculated by querying the data feed contract again to get the new price) to A and the rest to B. ethereum.org Such a contract would have significant potential in crypto-commerce. One of the main problems cited about cryptocurrency is the fact that it\\'s volatile; although many users and merchants may want the security and convenience of dealing with cryptographic assets, they many not wish to face that prospect of losing 23% of the value of their funds in a single day. Up until now, the most commonly proposed solution has been issuer-backed assets; the idea is that an issuer creates a sub-currency in which they have the right to issue and revoke units, and provide one unit of the currency to anyone who provides them (offline) with one unit of a specified underlying asset (eg. gold, USD). The issuer then promises to provide one unit of the underlying asset to anyone who sends back one unit of the crypto-asset. This mechanism allows any non-cryptographic asset to be \"uplifted\" into a cryptographic asset, provided that the issuer can be trusted. In practice, however, issuers are not always trustworthy, and in some cases the banking infrastructure is too weak, or too hostile, for such services to exist. Financial derivatives provide an alternative. Here, instead of a single issuer providing the funds to back up an asset, a decentralized market of speculators, betting that the price of a cryptographic reference asset will go up, plays that role. Unlike issuers, speculators have no option to default on their side of the bargain because the hedging contract holds their funds in escrow. Note that this approach is not fully decentralized, because a trusted source is still needed to provide the price ticker, although arguably even still this is a massive improvement in terms of reducing infrastructure requirements (unlike being an issuer, issuing a price feed requires no licenses and can likely be categorized as free speech) and reducing the potential for fraud. ethereum.org Identity and Reputation Systems The earliest alternative cryptocurrency of all, Namecoin, attempted to use a Bitcoin-like blockchain to provide a name registration system, where users can register their names in a public database alongside other data. The major cited use case is for a DNS system, mapping domain names like \"bitcoin.org\" (or, in Namecoin\\'s case, \"bitcoin.bit\") to an IP address. Other use cases include email authentication and potentially more advanced reputation systems.

Anyone can register a name with some value, and that registration then sticks forever. A more sophisticated name registration contract will also have a \"function clause\" allowing other contracts to query it, as well as a mechanism for the \"owner\" (ie. the first registerer) of a name to change the data or transfer ownership. One can even add reputation and web-of-trust functionality on top. Decentralized File Storage Over the past few years, there have emerged a number of popular online file storage startups, the most prominent being Dropbox, seeking to allow users to upload a backup of their hard drive and have the service store the backup and allow the user to access it in exchange for a monthly fee. However, at this point the file storage market is at times relatively inefficient; a cursory look at various existing solutions shows that, particularly at the \"uncanny valley\" 20-200 GB level at which neither free quotas nor enterprise-level discounts kick in, monthly prices for mainstream file storage costs are such that you are paying for more than the cost of the entire hard drive in a single month. Ethereum contracts can allow for the development of a decentralized file storage ecosystem, where individual users can earn small quantities of money by renting out their own hard drives and unused space can be used to further drive down the costs of file storage. The key underpinning piece of such a device would be what we have termed the \"decentralized Dropbox contract\". This contract works as follows. First, one splits the desired data up into blocks, encrypting each block for privacy, and builds a Merkle tree out of it. One then makes a contract with the rule that, every N blocks, the contract would pick a random index in the Merkle tree (using the previous block hash, accessible from contract code, as a source of randomness), and give X ether to the first entity to supply a transaction with a ethereum.org simplified payment verification-like proof of ownership of the block at that particular index in the tree. When a user wants to re-download their file, they can use a micropayment channel protocol (eg. pay 1 szabo per 32 kilobytes) to recover the file; the most fee-efficient approach is for the payer not to publish the transaction until the end, instead replacing the transaction with a slightly more lucrative one with the same nonce after every 32 kilobytes. An important feature of the protocol is that, although it may seem like one is trusting many random nodes not to decide to forget the file, one can reduce that risk down to near-zero by splitting the file into many pieces via secret sharing, and watching the contracts to see each piece is still in some node\\'s possession.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations The general concept of a \"decentralized organization\" is that of a virtual entity that has a certain set of members or shareholders which, perhaps with a 67% majority, have the right to spend the entity\\'s funds and modify its code. The members would collectively decide on how the organization should allocate its funds. Methods for allocating a DAO\\'s funds could range from bounties, salaries to even more exotic mechanisms such as an internal currency to reward work. This essentially replicates the legal trappings of a traditional company or nonprofit but using only cryptographic blockchain technology for enforcement. So far much of the talk around DAOs has been around the \"capitalist\" model of a \"decentralized autonomous corporation\" (DAC) with dividend-receiving shareholders and tradable shares; an alternative, perhaps described as a \"decentralized autonomous community\", would have all members have an equal share in the decision making and require 67% of existing members to agree to add or remove a member. The requirement that one person can only have one membership would then need to be enforced collectively by the group. A general outline for how to code a DO is as follows. The simplest design is simply a piece of self-modifying code that changes if two thirds of members agree on a change. Although code is theoretically immutable, one can easily get around this and have de-facto mutability by having chunks of the code in separate contracts, and having the address of which contracts to call stored in the modifiable storage. In a simple implementation of such a DAO contract, there would be three transaction types, distinguished by the data provided in the transaction: ● [0,i,K,V]to register a proposal with index i to change the address at storage index K to value V ● [0,i] to register a vote in favor of proposal i ● [2,i] to finalize proposal i if enough votes have been made The contract would then have clauses for each of these. It would maintain a record of all open storage changes, along with a list of who voted for them. It would also have a list of all members. When any storage ethereum.org change gets to two thirds of members voting for it, a finalizing transaction could execute the change. A more sophisticated skeleton would also have built-in voting ability for features like sending a transaction, adding members and removing members, and may even provide for Liquid Democracy-style vote delegation (ie. anyone can assign someone to vote for them, and assignment is transitive so if A assigns B and B assigns C then C determines A\\'s vote). This design would allow the DO to grow organically as a decentralized community, allowing people to eventually delegate the task of filtering out who is a member to specialists, although unlike in the \"current system\" specialists can easily pop in and out of existence over time as individual community members change their alignments. An alternative model is for a decentralized corporation, where'},\n",

An alternative model is for a decentralized corporation, where any account can have zero or more shares, and two thirds of the shares are required to make a decision. A complete skeleton would involve asset management functionality, the ability to make an offer to buy or sell shares, and the ability to accept offers (preferably with an order-matching mechanism inside the contract). Delegation would also exist Liquid Democracy-style, generalizing the concept of a \"board of directors\". In the future, more advanced mechanisms for organizational governance may be implemented; it is at this point that a decentralized organization (DO) can start to be described as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The difference between a DO and a DAO is fuzzy, but the general dividing line is whether the governance is generally carried out via a political-like process or an “automatic” process; a good intuitive test is the “no common language” criterion: can the organization still function if no two members spoke the same language? Clearly, a simple traditional shareholder-style corporation would fail, whereas something like the Bitcoin protocol would be much more likely to succeed. Robin Hanson’s futarchy, a mechanism for organizational governance via prediction markets, is a good example of what truly “autonomous” governance might look like. Note that one should not necessarily assume that all DAOs are superior to all DOs; automation is simply a paradigm that is likely to have have very large benefits in certain particular places and may not be practical in others, and many semi-DAOs are also likely to exist. Further Applications 1. Savings wallets. Suppose that Alice wants to keep her funds safe, but is worried that she will lose or someone will hack her private key. She puts ether into a contract with Bob, a bank, as follows: ● Alice alone can withdraw a maximum of 1% of the funds per day. ● Bob alone can withdraw a maximum of 1% of the funds per day, but Alice has the ability to make a transaction with her key shutting off this ability. ● Alice and Bob together can withdraw anything. Normally, 1% per day is enough for Alice, and if Alice wants to withdraw more she can contact Bob for help. If Alice\\'s key gets hacked, she runs to Bob to move the funds to a new contract. If she loses her key, Bob will get the funds out eventually. If Bob turns out to be malicious, then she can turn off his ability to withdraw. ethereum.org 2. Crop insurance.

If a farmer in Iowa purchases a derivative that pays out inversely based on the precipitation in Iowa, then if there is a drought, the farmer will automatically receive money and if there is enough rain the farmer will be happy because their crops would do well. 3. A decentralized data feed. For financial contracts for difference, it may actually be possible to decentralize the data feed via a protocol called \"SchellingCoin\". SchellingCoin basically works as follows: N parties all put into the system the value of a given datum (eg. the ETH/USD price), the values are sorted, and everyone between the 25th and 75th percentile gets one token as a reward. Everyone has the incentive to provide the answer that everyone else will provide, and the only value that a large number of players can realistically agree on is the obvious default: the truth. This creates a decentralized protocol that can theoretically provide any number of values, including the ETH/USD price, the temperature in Berlin or even the result of a particular hard computation. 4. Smart multi-signature escrow. Bitcoin allows multisignature transaction contracts where, for example, three out of a given five keys can spend the funds. Ethereum allows for more granularity; for example, four out of five can spend everything, three out of five can spend up to 10% per day, and two out of five can spend up to 0.5% per day. Additionally, Ethereum multisig is asynchronous - two parties can register their signatures on the blockchain at different times and the last signature will automatically send the transaction. 5. Cloud computing. The EVM technology can also be used to create a verifiable computing environment, allowing users to ask others to carry out computations and then optionally ask for proofs that computations at certain randomly selected checkpoints were done correctly. This allows for the creation of a cloud computing market where any user can participate with their desktop, laptop or specialized server, and spot-checking together with security deposits can be used to ensure that the system is trustworthy (ie. nodes cannot profitably cheat). Although such a system may not be suitable for all tasks; tasks that require a high level of inter-process communication, for example, cannot easily be done on a large cloud of nodes. Other tasks, however, are much easier to parallelize; projects like [EMAIL] [EMAIL] and genetic algorithms can easily be implemented on top of such a platform. 6. Peer-to-peer gambling. Any number of peer-to-peer gambling protocols, such as Frank Stajano and Richard Clayton\\'s Cyberdice, can be implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. The simplest gambling protocol is actually simply a contract for difference on the next block hash, and more advanced protocols can be built up from there, creating gambling services with near-zero fees that have no ability to cheat. 7. Prediction markets. Provided an oracle or SchellingCoin, prediction markets are also easy to implement, and prediction markets together with SchellingCoin may prove to be the first mainstream application of futarchy as a governance protocol for decentralized organizations. 8.

The motivation behind GHOST is that blockchains with fast confirmation times currently suffer from reduced security due to a high stale rate - because blocks take a certain time to propagate through the network, if miner A mines a block and then miner B happens to mine another block before miner A\\'s block propagates to B, miner B\\'s block will end up wasted and will not contribute to network security. Furthermore, there is a centralization issue: if miner A is a mining pool with 30% hashpower and B has 10% hashpower, A will have a risk of producing a stale block 70% of the time (since the other 30% of the time A produced the last block and so will get mining data immediately) whereas B will have a risk of producing a stale block 90% of the time. Thus, if the block interval is short enough for the stale rate to be high, A will be substantially more efficient simply by virtue of its size. With these two effects combined, blockchains which produce blocks quickly are very likely to lead to one mining pool having a large enough percentage of the network hashpower to have de facto control over the mining process. As described by Sompolinsky and Zohar, GHOST solves the first issue of network security loss by including stale blocks in the calculation of which chain is the \"longest\"; that is to say, not just the parent and further ancestors of a block, but also the stale children of the block\\'s ancestors (in Ethereum jargon, \"uncles\") are added to the calculation of which block has the largest total proof of work backing it. To solve the second issue of centralization bias, we go beyond the protocol described by Sompolinsky and Zohar, and also allow stales to be registered into the main chain to receive a block reward: a stale block receives 93.75% of its base reward, and the nephew that includes the stale block receives the remaining 6.25%. Transaction fees, however, are not awarded to uncles. Ethereum implements a simplified version of GHOST which only goes down five levels. Specifically, a stale block can only be included as an uncle by the 2nd to 5th generation child of its parent, and not any block with a more distant relation (eg. 6th generation child of a parent, or 3rd generation child of a grandparent). This was done for several reasons. First, unlimited GHOST would include too many complications into the calculation of which uncles for a given block are valid. Second, unlimited GHOST with compensation as used in Ethereum removes the incentive for a miner to mine on the main chain and not the chain of a public attacker. Finally, calculations show that five-level GHOST with incentivization is over 95% efficient even with a 15s block time, and miners with 25% hashpower show centralization gains of less than 3%. ethereum.org Fees Because every transaction published into the blockchain imposes on the network the cost of needing to download and verify it, there is a need for some regulatory mechanism, typically involving transaction fees, to prevent abuse.

The default approach, used in Bitcoin, is to have purely voluntary fees, relying on miners to act as the gatekeepers and set dynamic minimums. This approach has been received very favorably in the Bitcoin community particularly because it is \"market-based\", allowing supply and demand between miners and transaction senders determine the price. The problem with this line of reasoning is, however, that transaction processing is not a market; although it is intuitively attractive to construe transaction processing as a service that the miner is offering to the sender, in reality every transaction that a miner includes will need to be processed by every node in the network, so the vast majority of the cost of transaction processing is borne by third parties and not the miner that is making the decision of whether or not to include it. Hence, tragedy-of-the-commons problems are very likely to occur. However, as it turns out this flaw in the market-based mechanism, when given a particular inaccurate simplifying assumption, magically cancels itself out. The argument is as follows. Suppose that: 1. A transaction leads to k operations, offering the reward kR to any miner that includes it where R is set by the sender and k and R are (roughly) visible to the miner beforehand. 2. An operation has a processing cost of C to any node (ie. all nodes have equal efficiency) 3. There are N mining nodes, each with exactly equal processing power (ie. 1/N of total) 4. No non-mining full nodes exist. A miner would be willing to process a transaction if the expected reward is greater than the cost. Thus, the expected reward is kR/N since the miner has a 1/N chance of processing the next block, and the processing cost for the miner is simply kC. Hence, miners will include transactions where kR/N > kC, or R > NC. Note that R is the per-operation fee provided by the sender, and is thus a lower bound on the benefit that the sender derives from the transaction, and NC is the cost to the entire network together of processing an operation. Hence, miners have the incentive to include only those transactions for which the total utilitarian benefit exceeds the cost. However, there are several important deviations from those assumptions in reality: 1. The miner does pay a higher cost to process the transaction than the other verifying nodes, since the extra verification time delays block propagation and thus increases the chance the block will become a stale. 2. There do exist non-mining full nodes. ethereum.org 3. The mining power distribution may end up radically inegalitarian in practice. 4. Speculators, political enemies and crazies whose utility function includes causing harm to the network do exist, and they can cleverly set up contracts whose cost is much lower than the cost paid by other verifying nodes. Point 1 above provides a tendency for the miner to include fewer transactions, and point 2 increases NC; hence, these two effects at least partially cancel each other out.

Points 3 and 4 are the major issue; to solve them we simply institute a floating cap: no block can have more operations than BLK_LIMIT_FACTOR times the long-term exponential moving average. Specifically: blk.oplimit = floor((blk.parent.oplimit * (EMAFACTOR - 1) + floor(parent.opcount * BLK_LIMIT_FACTOR)) / EMA_FACTOR) BLK_LIMIT_FACTOR and EMA_FACTOR are constants that will be set to 65536 and 1.5 for the time being, but will likely be changed after further analysis. Computation And Turing-Completeness An important note is that the Ethereum virtual machine is Turing-complete; this means that EVM code can encode any computation that can be conceivably carried out, including infinite loops. EVM code allows looping in two ways. First, there is a JUMP instruction that allows the program to jump back to a previous spot in the code, and a JUMPI instruction to do conditional jumping, allowing for statements like while x < 27: x = x * 2. Second, contracts can call other contracts, potentially allowing for looping through recursion. This naturally leads to a problem: can malicious users essentially shut miners and full nodes down by forcing them to enter into an infinite loop? The issue arises because of a problem in computer science known as the halting problem: there is no way to tell, in the general case, whether or not a given program will ever halt. As described in the state transition section, our solution works by requiring a transaction to set a maximum number of computational steps that it is allowed to take, and if execution takes longer computation is reverted but fees are still paid. Messages work in the same way. To show the motivation behind our solution, consider the following examples: ● An attacker creates a contract which runs an infinite loop, and then sends a transaction activating that loop to the miner. The miner will process the transaction, running the infinite loop, and wait for it to run out of gas. Even though the execution runs out of gas and stops halfway through, the transaction is still valid and the miner still claims the fee from the attacker for each computational step. ● An attacker creates a very long infinite loop with the intent of forcing the miner to keep computing for such a long time that by the time computation finishes a few more blocks will have come out and it will not be possible for the miner to include the transaction to claim the fee. However, ethereum.org the attacker will be required to submit a value for STARTGAS limiting the number of computational steps that execution can take, so the miner will know ahead of time that the computation will take an excessively large number of steps. ● An attacker sees a contract with code of some form like send(A,contract.storage[A]); contract.storage[A] = 0, and sends a transaction with just enough gas to run the first step but not the second (ie. making a withdrawal but not letting the balance go down).

The contract author does not need to worry about protecting against such attacks, because if execution stops halfway through the changes get reverted. ● A financial contract works by taking the median of nine proprietary data feeds in order to minimize risk. An attacker takes over one of the data feeds, which is designed to be modifiable via the variable-address-call mechanism described in the section on DAOs, and converts it to run an infinite loop, thereby attempting to force any attempts to claim funds from the financial contract to run out of gas. However, the financial contract can set a gas limit on the message to prevent this problem. The alternative to Turing-completeness is Turing-incompleteness, where JUMP and JUMPI do not exist and only one copy of each contract is allowed to exist in the call stack at any given time. With this system, the fee system described and the uncertainties around the effectiveness of our solution might not be necessary, as the cost of executing a contract would be bounded above by its size. Additionally, Turing-incompleteness is not even that big a limitation; out of all the contract examples we have conceived internally, so far only one required a loop, and even that loop could be removed by making 26 repetitions of a one-line piece of code. Given the serious implications of Turing-completeness, and the limited benefit, why not simply have a Turing-incomplete language? In reality, however, Turing-incompleteness is far from a neat solution to the problem. To see why, consider the following contracts: C0: call(C1); call(C1); C1: call(C2); call(C2); C2: call(C3); call(C3); C49: call(C50); call(C50); C50: (run one step of a program and record the change in storage) Now, send a transaction to A. Thus, in 51 transactions, we have a contract that takes up 250 computational steps. Miners could try to detect such logic bombs ahead of time by maintaining a value alongside each contract specifying the maximum number of computational steps that it can take, and calculating this for contracts calling other contracts recursively, but that would require miners to forbid contracts that create other contracts (since the creation and execution of all 50 contracts above could easily be rolled into a single contract). Another problematic point is that the address field of a message is a variable, so in general it may not even be possible to tell which other contracts a given contract will call ahead of time. Hence, all in all, we have a surprising conclusion: Turing-completeness is surprisingly easy to manage, and the lack of ethereum.org Turing-completeness is equally surprisingly difficult to manage unless the exact same controls are in place - but in that case why not just let the protocol be Turing-complete?

In the near future, we expect \"ether\" to be used for ordinary transactions, \"finney\" for microtransactions and \"szabo\" and \"wei\" for technical discussions around fees and protocol implementation. The issuance model will be as follows: ● Ether will be released in a currency sale at the price of 1337-2000 ether per BTC, a mechanism intended to fund the Ethereum organization and pay for development that has been used with success by a number of other cryptographic platforms. Earlier buyers will benefit from larger discounts. The BTC received from the sale will be used entirely to pay salaries and bounties to developers, researchers and projects in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. ● 0.099x the total amount sold will be allocated to early contributors who participated in development before BTC funding or certainty of funding was available, and another 0.099x will be allocated to long-term research projects. ● 0.26x the total amount sold will be allocated to miners per year forever after that point. ethereum.org Issuance Breakdown The permanent linear supply growth model reduces the risk of what some see as excessive wealth concentration in Bitcoin, and gives individuals living in present and future eras a fair chance to acquire currency units, while at the same time discouraging depreciation of ether because the \"supply growth rate\" as a percentage still tends to zero over time. We also theorize that because coins are always lost over time due to carelessness, death, etc, and coin loss can be modeled as a percentage of the total supply per year, that the total currency supply in circulation will in fact eventually stabilize at a value equal to the annual issuance divided by the loss rate (eg. at a loss rate of 1%, once the supply reaches 26X then 0.26X will be mined and 0.26X lost every year, creating an equilibrium).

However, this mining algorithm is vulnerable to two forms of centralization. First, the mining ecosystem has come to be dominated by ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), computer chips designed for, and therefore thousands of times more efficient at, the specific task of Bitcoin mining. This means that Bitcoin mining is no longer a highly decentralized and egalitarian pursuit, requiring millions of dollars of capital to effectively participate in.'},\n",

This means that Bitcoin mining is no longer a highly decentralized and egalitarian pursuit, requiring millions of dollars of capital to effectively participate in. Second, most Bitcoin miners do not actually perform block validation locally; instead, they rely on a centralized mining pool to provide the block headers. This problem is arguably worse: as of the time of this writing, the top two mining pools indirectly control roughly 50% of processing power in the Bitcoin network, although this is mitigated by the fact that miners can switch to other mining pools if a pool or coalition attempts a 51% attack. The current intent at Ethereum is to use a mining algorithm based on randomly generating a unique hash function for every 1000 nonces, using a sufficiently broad range of computation to remove the benefit of specialized hardware. Such a strategy will certainly not reduce the gain of centralization to zero, but it does not need to. Note that each individual user, on their private laptop or desktop, can perform a certain quantity of mining activity almost for free, paying only electricity costs, but after the point of 100% CPU utilization of their computer additional mining will require them to pay for both electricity and hardware. ASIC mining companies need to pay for electricity and hardware starting from the first hash. Hence, if the centralization gain can be kept to below this ratio, (E + H) / E, then even if ASICs are made there will still be room for ordinary miners. Additionally, we intend to design the mining algorithm so that mining requires access to the entire blockchain, forcing miners to store the entire blockchain and at least be capable of verifying every transaction. This removes the need for centralized mining pools; although mining pools can still serve the legitimate role of evening out the randomness of reward distribution, this function can be served equally well by peer-to-peer pools with no central control. It additionally helps fight centralization, by increasing the number of full nodes in the network so that the network remains reasonably decentralized even if most ordinary users prefer light clients. ethereum.org Scalability One common concern about Ethereum is the issue of scalability. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum suffers from the flaw that every transaction needs to be processed by every node in the network. With Bitcoin, the size of the current blockchain rests at about 20 GB, growing by about 1 MB per hour. If the Bitcoin network were to process Visa's 2000 transactions per second, it would grow by 1 MB per three seconds (1 GB per hour, 8 TB per year). Ethereum is likely to suffer a similar growth pattern, worsened by the fact that there will be many applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain instead of just a currency as is the case with Bitcoin, but ameliorated by the fact that Ethereum full nodes need to store just the state instead of the entire blockchain history. The problem with such a large blockchain size is centralization risk. If the blockchain size increases to, say, 100 TB, then the likely scenario would be that only a very small number of\"},\n",

The problem with such a large blockchain size is centralization risk. If the blockchain size increases to, say, 100 TB, then the likely scenario would be that only a very small number of large businesses would run full nodes, with all regular users using light SPV nodes. In such a situation, there arises the potential concern that the full nodes could band together and all agree to cheat in some profitable fashion (eg. change the block reward, give themselves BTC). Light nodes would have no way of detecting this immediately. Of course, at least one honest full node would likely exist, and after a few hours information about the fraud would trickle out through channels like Reddit, but at that point it would be too late: it would be up to the ordinary users to organize an effort to blacklist the given blocks, a massive and likely infeasible coordination problem on a similar scale as that of pulling off a successful 51% attack. In the case of Bitcoin, this is currently a problem, but there exists a blockchain modification suggested by Peter Todd which will alleviate this issue. In the near term, Ethereum will use two additional strategies to cope with this problem. First, because of the blockchain-based mining algorithms, at least every miner will be forced to be a full node, creating a lower bound on the number of full nodes. Second and more importantly, however, we will include an intermediate state tree root in the blockchain after processing each transaction. Even if block validation is centralized, as long as one honest verifying node exists, the centralization problem can be circumvented via a verification protocol. If a miner publishes an invalid block, that block must either be badly formatted, or the state S[n] is incorrect. Since S[0] is known to be correct, there must be some first state S[i] that is incorrect where S[i-1] is correct. The verifying node would provide the index i, along with a \"proof of invalidity\" consisting of the subset of Patricia tree nodes needing to process APPLY(S[i-1],TX[i]) -> S[i]. Nodes would be able to use those nodes to run that part of the computation, and see that the S[i] generated does not match the S[i] provided. Another, more sophisticated, attack would involve the malicious miners publishing incomplete blocks, so the full information does not even exist to determine whether or not blocks are valid. The solution to this is a challenge-response protocol: verification nodes issue \"challenges\" in the form of target transaction indices, and upon receiving a node a light node treats the block as untrusted until another node, whether the miner or another verifier, provides a subset of Patricia nodes as a proof of validity. ethereum.org Putting It All Together: Decentralized Applications The contract mechanism described above allows anyone to build what is essentially a command line application run on a virtual machine that is executed by consensus across the entire network, allowing it to modify a globally accessible state as its “hard drive”.

However, for most people, the command line interface that is the transaction sending mechanism is not sufficiently user-friendly to make decentralization an attractive mainstream alternative. To this end, a complete “decentralized application” should consist of both low-level business-logic components, whether implemented entirely on Ethereum, using a combination of Ethereum and other systems (eg. a P2P messaging layer, one of which is currently planned to be put into the Ethereum clients) or other systems entirely, and high-level graphical user interface components. The Ethereum client’s design is to serve as a web browser, but include support for a “eth” Javascript API object, which specialized web pages viewed in the client will be able to use to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. From the point of view of the “traditional” web, these web pages are entirely static content, since the blockchain and other decentralized protocols will serve as a complete replacement for the server for the purpose of handling user-initiated requests. Eventually, decentralized protocols, hopefully themselves in some fashion using Ethereum, may be used to store the web pages themselves. Conclusion The Ethereum protocol was originally conceived as an upgraded version of a cryptocurrency, providing advanced features such as on-blockchain escrow, withdrawal limits and financial contracts, gambling markets and the like via a highly generalized programming language. The Ethereum protocol would not \"support\" any of the applications directly, but the existence of a Turing-complete programming language means that arbitrary contracts can theoretically be created for any transaction type or application. What is more interesting about Ethereum, however, is that the Ethereum protocol moves far beyond just currency. Protocols and decentralized applications around decentralized file storage, decentralized computation and decentralized prediction markets, among dozens of other such concepts, have the potential to substantially increase the efficiency of the computational industry, and provide a massive boost to other peer-to-peer protocols by adding for the first time an economic layer. Finally, there is also a substantial array of applications that have nothing to do with money at all. The concept of an arbitrary state transition function as implemented by the Ethereum protocol provides for a platform with unique potential; rather than being a closed-ended, single-purpose protocol intended for a specific array of applications in data storage, gambling or finance, Ethereum is open-ended by design, and we believe that it is extremely well-suited to serving as a foundational layer for a very large number of both financial and non-financial protocols in the years to come. ethereum.org Notes and Further Reading Notes 1. A sophisticated reader may notice that in fact a Bitcoin address is the hash of the elliptic curve public key, and not the public key itself. However, it is in fact perfectly legitimate cryptographic terminology to refer to the pubkey hash as a public key itself. This is because Bitcoin\\'s cryptography can be considered to be a custom digital signature algorithm, where the public key consists of the hash of the ECC pubkey, the signature consists of the ECC pubkey concatenated with the ECC signature, and the verification algorithm involves checking the ECC pubkey in the signature against the ECC pubkey hash provided as a public key and then verifying the ECC signature against the ECC pubkey.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'ETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER EIP-150 REVISION DR. GAVIN WOOD FOUNDER, ETHEREUM & ETHCORE [EMAIL] Abstract. The blockchain paradigm when coupled with cryptographically-secured transactions has demonstrated its utility through a number of projects, not least Bitcoin. Each such project can be seen as a simple application on a decentralised, but singleton, compute resource. We can call this paradigm a transactional singleton machine with shared-state. Ethereum implements this paradigm in a generalised manner. Furthermore it provides a plurality of such resources, each with a distinct state and operating code but able to interact through a message-passing framework with others. We discuss its design, implementation issues, the opportunities it provides and the future hurdles we envisage. 1. Introduction With ubiquitous internet connections in most places of the world, global information transmission has become incredibly cheap. Technology-rooted movements like Bit- coin have demonstrated, through the power of the default, consensus mechanisms and voluntary respect of the social contract that it is possible to use the internet to make a decentralised value-transfer system, shared across the world and virtually free to use. This system can be said to be a very specialised version of a cryptographically se- cure, transaction-based state machine. Follow-up systems such as Namecoin adapted this original “currency appli- cation” of the technology into other applications albeit rather simplistic ones. Ethereum is a project which attempts to build the gen- eralised technology; technology on which all transaction- based state machine concepts may be built. Moreover it aims to provide to the end-developer a tightly integrated end-to-end system for building software on a hitherto un- explored compute paradigm in the mainstream: a trustful object messaging compute framework. 1.1. Driving Factors. There are many goals of this project; one key goal is to facilitate transactions be- tween consenting individuals who would otherwise have no means to trust one another. This may be due to geographical separation, interfacing difficulty, or perhaps the incompatibility, incompetence, unwillingness, expense, uncertainty, inconvenience or corruption of existing legal systems. By specifying a state-change system through a rich and unambiguous language, and furthermore archi- tecting a system such that we can reasonably expect that an agreement will be thus enforced autonomously, we can provide a means to this end. Dealings in this proposed system would have several attributes not often found in the real world. The incor- ruptibility of judgement, often difficult to find, comes nat- urally from a disinterested algorithmic interpreter. Trans- parency, or being able to see exactly how a state or judge- ment came about through the transaction log and rules or instructional codes, never happens perfectly in human- based systems since natural language is necessarily vague, information is often lacking, and plain old prejudices are difficult to shake. Overall, I wish to provide a system such that users can be guaranteed that no matter with which other individ- uals, systems or organisations they interact, they can do so with absolute confidence in the possible outcomes and how those outcomes might come about. 1.2. Previous Work. Buterin [2013a] first proposed the kernel of this work in late November, 2013. Though now evolved in many ways, the key functionality of a block- chain with a Turing-complete language and an effectively unlimited inter-transaction storage capability remains un- changed. Dwork and Naor [1992] provided the first work into the usage of a cryptographic proof of computational expendi- ture (“proof-of-work”) as a means of transmitting a value signal over the Internet.

Dwork and Naor [1992] provided the first work into the usage of a cryptographic proof of computational expendi- ture (“proof-of-work”) as a means of transmitting a value signal over the Internet. The value-signal was utilised here as a spam deterrence mechanism rather than any kind of currency, but critically demonstrated the potential for a basic data channel to carry a strong economic signal, allowing a receiver to make a physical assertion without having to rely upon trust. Back [2002] later produced a system in a similar vein. The first example of utilising the proof-of-work as a strong economic signal to secure a currency was by Vish- numurthy et al. [2003]. In this instance, the token was used to keep peer-to-peer file trading in check, ensuring “consumers” be able to make micro-payments to “suppli- ers” for their services. The security model afforded by the proof-of-work was augmented with digital signatures and a ledger in order to ensure that the historical record couldn’t be corrupted and that malicious actors could not spoof payment or unjustly complain about service deliv- ery. Five years later, Nakamoto [2008] introduced an- other such proof-of-work-secured value token, somewhat wider in scope. The fruits of this project, Bitcoin, became the first widely adopted global decentralised transaction ledger. Other projects built on Bitcoin’s success; the alt-coins introduced numerous other currencies through alteration to the protocol. Some of the best known are Litecoin and Primecoin, discussed by Sprankel [2013]. Other projects sought to take the core value content mechanism of the ETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER EIP-150 REVISION protocol and repurpose it; Aron [2012] discusses, for ex- ample, the Namecoin project which aims to provide a de- centralised name-resolution system. Other projects still aim to build upon the Bitcoin net- work itself, leveraging the large amount of value placed in the system and the vast amount of computation that goes into the consensus mechanism. The Mastercoin project, first proposed by Willett [2013], aims to build a richer protocol involving many additional high-level features on top of the Bitcoin protocol through utilisation of a num- ber of auxiliary parts to the core protocol. The Coloured Coins project, proposed by Rosenfeld [2012], takes a sim- ilar but more simplified strategy, embellishing the rules of a transaction in order to break the fungibility of Bit- coin’s base currency and allow the creation and tracking of tokens through a special “chroma-wallet”-protocol-aware piece of software. Additional work has been done in the area with discard- ing the decentralisation foundation; Ripple, discussed by Boutellier and Heinzen [2014], has sought to create a “fed- erated” system for currency exchange, effectively creating a new financial clearing system. It has demonstrated that high efficiency gains can be made if the decentralisation premise is discarded. Early work on smart contracts has been done by Szabo [1997] and Miller [1997]. Around the 1990s it became clear that algorithmic enforcement of agreements could become a significant force in human cooperation. Though no spe- cific system was proposed to implement such a system, it was proposed that the future of law would be heavily affected by such systems. In this light, Ethereum may be seen as a general implementation of such a crypto-law system. 2.

The Blockchain Paradigm Ethereum, taken as a whole, can be viewed as a transaction-based state machine: we begin with a gene- sis state and incrementally execute transactions to morph it into some final state. It is this final state which we ac- cept as the canonical “version” of the world of Ethereum. The state can include such information as account bal- ances, reputations, trust arrangements, data pertaining to information of the physical world; in short, anything that can currently be represented by a computer is admis- sible. Transactions thus represent a valid arc between two states; the ‘valid’ part is important-there exist far more invalid state changes than valid state changes. Invalid state changes might, e.g. be things such as reducing an account balance without an equal and opposite increase elsewhere. A valid state transition is one which comes about through a transaction. Formally: (1) σt+1 ≡Υ(σt, T) where Υ is the Ethereum state transition function. In Ethereum, Υ, together with σ are considerably more pow- erful then any existing comparable system; Υ allows com- ponents to carry out arbitrary computation, while σ al- lows components to store arbitrary state between trans- actions. Transactions are collated into blocks; blocks are chained together using a cryptographic hash as a means of reference. Blocks function as a journal, recording a series of transactions together with the previous block and an identifier for the final state (though do not store the final state itself-that would be far too big). They also punc- tuate the transaction series with incentives for nodes to mine. This incentivisation takes place as a state-transition function, adding value to a nominated account. Mining is the process of dedicating effort (working) to bolster one series of transactions (a block) over any other potential competitor block. It is achieved thanks to a cryptographically secure proof. This scheme is known as a proof-of-work and is discussed in detail in section 11.5. Formally, we expand to: σt+1 ≡ Π(σt, B) (2) B ≡ (..., (T0, T1, ...)) (3) Π(σ, B) ≡ Ω(B, Υ(Υ(σ, T0), T1)...) (4) Where Ωis the block-finalisation state transition func- tion (a function that rewards a nominated party); B is this block, which includes a series of transactions amongst some other components; and Π is the block-level state- transition function. This is the basis of the blockchain paradigm, a model that forms the backbone of not only Ethereum, but all de- centralised consensus-based transaction systems to date. 2.1. Value. In order to incentivise computation within the network, there needs to be an agreed method for trans- mitting value. To address this issue, Ethereum has an in- trinsic currency, Ether, known also as ETH and sometimes referred to by the Old English ¯D. The smallest subdenom- ination of Ether, and thus the one in which all integer val- ues of the currency are counted, is the Wei. One Ether is defined as being 1018 Wei. There exist other subdenomi- nations of Ether: Multiplier Name Wei Szabo Finney Ether Throughout the present work, any reference to value, in the context of Ether, currency, a balance or a payment, should be assumed to be counted in Wei. 2.2.

Which History? Since the system is decentralised and all parties have an opportunity to create a new block on some older pre-existing block, the resultant structure is necessarily a tree of blocks. In order to form a consensus as to which path, from root (the genesis block) to leaf (the block containing the most recent transactions) through this tree structure, known as the blockchain, there must be an agreed-upon scheme. If there is ever a disagree- ment between nodes as to which root-to-leaf path down the block tree is the ‘best’ blockchain, then a fork occurs. This would mean that past a given point in time (block), multiple states of the system may coexist: some nodes believing one block to contain the canonical transac- tions, other nodes believing some other block to be canoni- cal, potentially containing radically different or incompat- ible transactions. This is to be avoided at all costs as the uncertainty that would ensue would likely kill all confi- dence in the entire system. The scheme we use in order to generate consensus is a simplified version of the GHOST protocol introduced by ETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER EIP-150 REVISION Sompolinsky and Zohar [2013]. This process is described in detail in section 10. 3. Conventions I use a number of typographical conventions for the formal notation, some of which are quite particular to the present work: The two sets of highly structured, ‘top-level’, state val- ues, are denoted with bold lowercase Greek letters. They fall into those of world-state, which are denoted σ (or a variant thereupon) and those of machine-state, µ. Functions operating on highly structured values are denoted with an upper-case greek letter, e.g. Υ, the Ethereum state transition function. For most functions, an uppercase letter is used, e.g. C, the general cost function. These may be subscripted to denote specialised variants, e.g. CSSTORE, the cost func- tion for the SSTORE operation. For specialised and possibly externally defined functions, I may format as typewriter text, e.g. the Keccak-256 hash function (as per the winning entry to the SHA-3 contest) is denoted KEC (and generally referred to as plain Keccak). Also KEC512 is referring to the Keccak 512 hash function. Tuples are typically denoted with an upper-case letter, e.g. T, is used to denote an Ethereum transaction. This symbol may, if accordingly defined, be subscripted to re- fer to an individual component, e.g. Tn, denotes the nonce of said transaction. The form of the subscript is used to denote its type; e.g. uppercase subscripts refer to tuples with subscriptable components. Scalars and fixed-size byte sequences (or, synony- mously, arrays) are denoted with a normal lower-case let- ter, e.g. n is used in the document to denote a transaction nonce. Those with a particularly special meaning may be greek, e.g. δ, the number of items required on the stack for a given operation. Arbitrary-length sequences are typically denoted as a bold lower-case letter, e.g. o is used to denote the byte- sequence given as the output'},\n",

Arbitrary-length sequences are typically denoted as a bold lower-case letter, e.g. o is used to denote the byte- sequence given as the output data of a message call. For particularly important values, a bold uppercase letter may be used. Throughout, we assume scalars are positive integers and thus belong to the set P. The set of all byte sequences is B, formally defined in Appendix B. If such a set of se- quences is restricted to those of a particular length, it is denoted with a subscript, thus the set of all byte sequences of length 32 is named B32 and the set of all positive in- tegers smaller than 2256 is named P256. This is formally defined in section 4.4. Square brackets are used to index into and reference individual components or subsequences of sequences, e.g. µs[0] denotes the first item on the machine’s stack. For subsequences, ellipses are used to specify the intended range, to include elements at both limits, e.g. µm[0..31] denotes the first 32 items of the machine’s memory. In the case of the global state σ, which is a sequence of accounts, themselves tuples, the square brackets are used to reference an individual account. When considering variants of existing values, I follow the rule that within a given scope for definition, if we assume that the unmodified ‘input’ value be denoted by the placeholder □then the modified and utilisable value is denoted as □′, and intermediate values would be □∗, □∗∗&c. On very particular occasions, in order to max- imise readability and only if unambiguous in meaning, I may use alpha-numeric subscripts to denote intermediate values, especially those of particular note. When considering the use of existing functions, given a function f, the function f ∗denotes a similar, element- wise version of the function mapping instead between se- quences. It is formally defined in section 4.4. I define a number of useful functions throughout. One of the more common is ℓ, which evaluates to the last item in the given sequence: (5) ℓ(x) ≡x[∥x∥−1] 4. Blocks, State and Transactions Having introduced the basic concepts behind Ethereum, we will discuss the meaning of a transaction, a block and the state in more detail. 4.1. World State. The world state (state), is a map- ping between addresses (160-bit identifiers) and account states (a data structure serialised as RLP, see Appendix B). Though not stored on the blockchain, it is assumed that the implementation will maintain this mapping in a modified Merkle Patricia tree (trie, see Appendix D). The trie requires a simple database backend that maintains a mapping of bytearrays to bytearrays; we name this under- lying database the state database. This has a number of benefits; firstly the root node of this structure is crypto- graphically dependent on all internal data and as such its hash can be used as a secure identity for the entire sys- tem state. Secondly, being an immutable data structure, it allows any previous state (whose root hash is known) to be recalled by simply altering the root hash accordingly. Since we store all such root hashes in the blockchain, we are able to'},\n",

Secondly, being an immutable data structure, it allows any previous state (whose root hash is known) to be recalled by simply altering the root hash accordingly. Since we store all such root hashes in the blockchain, we are able to trivially revert to old states. The account state comprises the following four fields: nonce: A scalar value equal to the number of trans- actions sent from this address or, in the case of accounts with associated code, the number of contract-creations made by this account. For ac- count of address a in state σ, this would be for- mally denoted σ[a]n. balance: A scalar value equal to the number of Wei owned by this address. Formally denoted σ[a]b. storageRoot: A 256-bit hash of the root node of a Merkle Patricia tree that encodes the storage con- tents of the account (a mapping between 256-bit integer values), encoded into the trie as a map- ping from the Keccak 256-bit hash of the 256-bit integer keys to the RLP-encoded 256-bit integer values. The hash is formally denoted σ[a]s. codeHash: The hash of the EVM code of this account-this is the code that gets executed should this address receive a message call; it is immutable and thus, unlike all other fields, can- not be changed after construction. All such code fragments are contained in the state database un- der their corresponding hashes for later retrieval. This hash is formally denoted σ[a]c, and thus the code may be denoted as b, given that KEC(b) = σ[a]c. ETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER EIP-150 REVISION Since I typically wish to refer not to the trie’s root hash but to the underlying set of key/value pairs stored within, I define a convenient equivalence: (6) TRIE L∗ I(σ[a]s) ≡σ[a]s The collapse function for the set of key/value pairs in the trie, L∗ I, is defined as the element-wise transformation of the base function LI, given as: (7) LI (k, v) ≡ KEC(k), RLP(v) where: (8) k ∈B32 ∧ v ∈P It shall be understood that σ[a]s is not a ‘physical’ member of the account and does not contribute to its later serialisation. If the codeHash field is the Keccak-256 hash of the empty string, i.e. σ[a]c = KEC () , then the node repre- sents a simple account, sometimes referred to as a “non- contract” account. Thus we may define a world-state collapse function LS: (9) LS(σ) ≡{p(a) : σ[a] ̸= ∅} where (10) p(a) ≡ KEC(a), RLP (σ[a]n, σ[a]b, σ[a]s, σ[a]c) This function, LS, is used alongside the trie function to provide a short identity (hash) of the world state. We assume: (11) ∀a : σ[a] = ∅∨(a ∈B20 ∧v(σ[a])) where v is the account validity function: (12) v(x) ≡xn ∈P256∧xb ∈P256∧xs ∈B32∧xc ∈B32 4.2. Homestead.

The Transaction. A transaction (formally, T) is a single cryptographically-signed instruction constructed by an actor externally to the scope of Ethereum. While is as- sumed that the ultimate external actor will be human in nature, software tools will be used in its construction and dissemination1. There are two types of transactions: those which result in message calls and those which result in the creation of new accounts with associated code (known informally as ‘contract creation’). Both types specify a number of common fields: nonce: A scalar value equal to the number of trans- actions sent by the sender; formally Tn. gasPrice: A scalar value equal to the number of Wei to be paid per unit of gas for all computa- tion costs incurred as a result of the execution of this transaction; formally Tp. gasLimit: A scalar value equal to the maximum amount of gas that should be used in executing this transaction. This is paid up-front, before any computation is done and may not be increased later; formally Tg. to: The 160-bit address of the message call’s recipi- ent or, for a contract creation transaction, ∅, used here to denote the only member of B0 ; formally Tt. value: A scalar value equal to the number of Wei to be transferred to the message call’s recipient or, in the case of contract creation, as an endowment to the newly created account; formally Tv. v, r, s: Values corresponding to the signature of the transaction and used to determine the sender of the transaction; formally Tw, Tr and Ts. This is expanded in Appendix F. Additionally, a contract creation transaction contains: init: An unlimited size byte array specifying the EVM-code for the account initialisation proce- dure, formally Ti. init is an EVM-code fragment; it returns the body, a second fragment of code that executes each time the account receives a message call (either through a trans- action or due to the internal execution of code). init is executed only once at account creation and gets discarded immediately thereafter. In contrast, a message call transaction contains: data: An unlimited size byte array specifying the input data of the message call, formally Td. Appendix F specifies the function, S, which maps transactions to the sender, and happens through the ECDSA of the SECP-256k1 curve, using the hash of the transaction (excepting the latter three signature fields) as the datum to sign. For the present we simply assert that the sender of a given transaction T can be represented with S(T).

ETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER EIP-150 REVISION 4.4. The Block. The block in Ethereum is the collec- tion of relevant pieces of information (known as the block header), H, together with information corresponding to the comprised transactions, T, and a set of other block headers U that are known to have a parent equal to the present block’s parent’s parent (such blocks are known as ommers2). The block header contains several pieces of information: parentHash: The Keccak 256-bit hash of the par- ent block’s header, in its entirety; formally Hp. ommersHash: The Keccak 256-bit hash of the om- mers list portion of this block; formally Ho. beneficiary: The 160-bit address to which all fees collected from the successful mining of this block be transferred; formally Hc. stateRoot: The Keccak 256-bit hash of the root node of the state trie, after all transactions are executed and finalisations applied; formally Hr. transactionsRoot: The Keccak 256-bit hash of the root node of the trie structure populated with each transaction in the transactions list portion of the block; formally Ht. receiptsRoot: The Keccak 256-bit hash of the root node of the trie structure populated with the re- ceipts of each transaction in the transactions list portion of the block; formally He. logsBloom: The Bloom filter composed from in- dexable information (logger address and log top- ics) contained in each log entry from the receipt of each transaction in the transactions list; formally Hb. difficulty: A scalar value corresponding to the dif- ficulty level of this block. This can be calculated from the previous block’s difficulty level and the timestamp; formally Hd. number: A scalar value equal to the number of an- cestor blocks. The genesis block has a number of zero; formally Hi. gasLimit: A scalar value equal to the current limit of gas expenditure per block; formally Hl. gasUsed: A scalar value equal to the total gas used in transactions in this block; formally Hg. timestamp: A scalar value equal to the reasonable output of Unix’s time() at this block’s inception; formally Hs. extraData: An arbitrary byte array containing data relevant to this block. This must be 32 bytes or fewer; formally Hx. mixHash: A 256-bit hash which proves combined with the nonce that a sufficient amount of compu- tation has been carried out on this block; formally Hm. nonce: A 64-bit hash which proves combined with the mix-hash that a sufficient amount of compu- tation has been carried out on this block;'},\n",

The other two components in the block are simply a list of ommer block headers (of the same format as above) and a series of the transactions. Formally, we can refer to a block B: (18) B ≡(BH, BT, BU) 4.4.1. Transaction Receipt. In order to encode informa- tion about a transaction concerning which it may be use- ful to form a zero-knowledge proof, or index and search, we encode a receipt of each transaction containing cer- tain information from concerning its execution. Each re- ceipt, denoted BR[i] for the ith transaction) is placed in an index-keyed trie and the root recorded in the header as He. The transaction receipt is a tuple of four items com- prising the post-transaction state, Rσ, the cumulative gas used in the block containing the transaction receipt as of immediately after the transaction has happened, Ru, the set of logs created through execution of the transaction, Rl and the Bloom filter composed from information in those logs, Rb: (19) R ≡(Rσ, Ru, Rb, Rl) The function LR trivially prepares a transaction receipt for being transformed into an RLP-serialised byte array: (20) LR(R) ≡(TRIE(LS(Rσ)), Ru, Rb, Rl) thus the post-transaction state, Rσ is encoded into a trie structure, the root of which forms the first item. We assert Ru, the cumulative gas used is a positive in- teger and that the logs Bloom, Rb, is a hash of size 2048 bits (256 bytes): (21) Ru ∈P ∧ Rb ∈B256 The log entries, Rl, is a series of log entries, termed, for example, (O0, O1, ...). A log entry, O, is a tuple of a logger’s address, Oa, a series of 32-bytes log topics, Ot and some number of bytes of data, Od: (22) O ≡(Oa, (Ot0, Ot1, ...), Od) (23) Oa ∈B20 ∧ ∀t∈Ot : t ∈B32 ∧ Od ∈B We define the Bloom filter function, M, to reduce a log entry into a single 256-byte hash: (24) M(O) ≡ t∈{Oa}∪Ot M3:2048(t) where M3:2048 is a specialised Bloom filter that sets three bits out of 2048, given an arbitrary byte series. It does this through taking the low-order 11 bits of each of the first three pairs of bytes in a Keccak-256 hash of the byte series. Formally: M3:2048(x : x ∈B) ≡ y : y ∈B256 where: (25) y = (0, 0, ..., 0) except: (26) ∀i∈{0,2,4} : Bm(x,i)(y) = 1 (27) m(x, i) ≡ KEC(x)[i, i + 1] mod 2048 (28) where B is the bit reference function such that Bj(x) equals the bit of index j (indexed from 0) in the byte array x. 2ommer is the most prevalent (not saying much) gender-neutral term to mean “sibling of parent”; see http://nonbinary.org/wiki/ Gender_neutral_language#Family_Terms ETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER EIP-150 REVISION 4.4.2.

The values stemming from the computation of transac- tions, specifically the transaction receipts, BR, and that defined through the transactions state-accumulation func- tion, Π, are formalised later in section 11.4. 4.4.3. Serialisation. The function LB and LH are the preparation functions for a block and block header respec- tively. Much like the transaction receipt preparation func- tion LR, we assert the types and order of the structure for when the RLP transformation is required: LH(H) ≡ ( Hp, Ho, Hc, Hr, Ht, He, Hb, Hd, Hi, Hl, Hg, Hs, Hx, Hm, Hn ) (32) LB(B) ≡ LH(BH), L∗ T (BT), L∗ H(BU) (33) With L∗ T and L∗ H being element-wise sequence trans- formations, thus: (34) f ∗(x0, x1, ...) ≡ f(x0), f(x1), ... for any function f The component types are defined thus: (35) Hp ∈B32 ∧ Ho ∈B32 ∧ Hc ∈B20 ∧ Hr ∈B32 ∧ Ht ∈B32 ∧ He ∈B32 ∧ Hb ∈B256 ∧ Hd ∈P ∧ Hi ∈P ∧ Hl ∈P ∧ Hg ∈P ∧ Hs ∈P256 ∧ Hx ∈B ∧ Hm ∈B32 ∧ Hn ∈B8 where (36) Bn = {B : B ∈B ∧∥B∥= n} We now have a rigorous specification for the construc- tion of a formal block structure. The RLP function RLP (see Appendix B) provides the canonical method for trans- forming this structure into a sequence of bytes ready for transmission over the wire or storage locally. 4.4.4.

Conversely, if the period is too large, the difficulty, and expected time to the next block, is reduced. The nonce, Hn, must satisfy the relations: (49) n ⩽2256 Hd ∧ m = Hm with (n, m) = PoW(Hn, Hn, d). Where Hn is the new block’s header H, but without the nonce and mix-hash components, d being the current DAG, a large data set needed to compute the mix-hash, and PoW is the proof-of-work function (see section 11.5): this evaluates to an array with the first item being the mix- hash, to proof that a correct DAG has been used, and the second item being a pseudo-random number cryptograph- ically dependent on H and d. Given an approximately uniform distribution in the range [0, 264), the expected time to find a solution is proportional to the difficulty, Hd. ETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER EIP-150 REVISION This is the foundation of the security of the blockchain and is the fundamental reason why a malicious node can- not propagate newly created blocks that would otherwise overwrite (“rewrite”) history. Because the nonce must satisfy this requirement, and because its satisfaction de- pends on the contents of the block and in turn its com- posed transactions, creating new, valid, blocks is difficult and, over time, requires approximately the total compute power of the trustworthy portion of the mining peers. Thus we are able to define the block header validity function V (H): V (H) ≡ n ⩽2256 Hd ∧m = Hm ∧ (50) Hd = D(H) ∧ (51) Hg ≤Hl ∧ (52) Hl < P(H)H l + P(H)H l ∧ (53) Hl > P(H)H l − P(H)H l ∧ (54) Hl ⩾125000 ∧ (55) Hs > P(H)H s ∧ (56) Hi = P(H)H i + 1 ∧ (57) ∥Hx∥≤32 (58) where (n, m) = PoW(Hn, Hn, d) Noting additionally that extraData must be at most 32 bytes. 5.

The fee schedule is specified in units of gas (see Appendix G for the fees associated with var- ious computation). Thus any given fragment of pro- grammable computation (this includes creating contracts, making message calls, utilising and accessing account stor- age and executing operations on the virtual machine) has a universally agreed cost in terms of gas. Every transaction has a specific amount of gas associ- ated with it: gasLimit. This is the amount of gas which is implicitly purchased from the sender’s account balance. The purchase happens at the according gasPrice, also specified in the transaction. The transaction is considered invalid if the account balance cannot support such a pur- chase. It is named gasLimit since any unused gas at the end of the transaction is refunded (at the same rate of pur- chase) to the sender’s account. Gas does not exist outside of the execution of a transaction. Thus for accounts with trusted code associated, a relatively high gas limit may be set and left alone. In general, Ether used to purchase gas that is not re- funded is delivered to the beneficiary address, the address of an account typically under the control of the miner. Transactors are free to specify any gasPrice that they wish, however miners are free to ignore transactions as they choose. A higher gas price on a transaction will there- fore cost the sender more in terms of Ether and deliver a greater value to the miner and thus will more likely be selected for inclusion by more miners. Miners, in general, will choose to advertise the minimum gas price for which they will execute transactions and transactors will be free to canvas these prices in determining what gas price to offer. Since there will be a (weighted) distribution of min- imum acceptable gas prices, transactors will necessarily have a trade-offto make between lowering the gas price and maximising the chance that their transaction will be mined in a timely manner. 6. Transaction Execution The execution of a transaction is the most complex part of the Ethereum protocol: it defines the state transition function Υ. It is assumed that any transactions executed first pass the initial tests of intrinsic validity. These in- clude: (1) The transaction is well-formed RLP, with no ad- ditional trailing bytes; (2) the transaction signature is valid; (3) the transaction nonce is valid (equivalent to the sender account’s current nonce); (4) the gas limit is no smaller than the intrinsic gas, g0, used by the transaction; (5) the sender account balance contains at least the cost, v0, required in up-front payment. Formally, we consider the function Υ, with T being a transaction and σ the state: (59) σ′ = Υ(σ, T) Thus σ′ is the post-transactional state. We also define Υg to evaluate to the amount of gas used in the execution of a transaction and Υl to evaluate to the transaction’s accrued log items, both to be formally defined later. 6.1. Substate. Throughout transaction execution, we accrue certain information that is acted upon immediately following the transaction. We call this transaction sub- state, and represent it as A, which is a tuple: (60) A ≡(As, Al, Ar) The tuple contents include As, the suicide set: a set of accounts that will be discarded following the transac- tion’s completion. Al is the log series:'},\n",

Al is the log series: this is a series of archived and indexable ‘checkpoints’ in VM code execu- tion that allow for contract-calls to be easily tracked by onlookers external to the Ethereum world (such as decen- tralised application front-ends). Finally there is Ar, the refund balance, increased through using the SSTORE in- struction in order to reset contract storage to zero from some non-zero value. Though not immediately refunded, it is allowed to partially offset the total execution costs. For brevity, we define the empty substate A0 to have no suicides, no logs and a zero refund balance: (61) A0 ≡(∅, (), 0) 6.2. Execution. We define intrinsic gas g0, the amount of gas this transaction requires to be paid prior to execu- tion, as follows: g0 ≡ X i∈Ti,Td ( Gtxdatazero if i = 0 Gtxdatanonzero otherwise (62) + ( Gtxcreate if Tt = ∅∧Hi ≥NH otherwise (63) + Gtransaction (64) ETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER EIP-150 REVISION where Ti, Td means the series of bytes of the trans- action’s associated data and initialisation EVM-code, depending on whether the transaction is for contract- creation or message-call. Gtxcreate is added if the transac- tion is contract-creating, but not if a result of EVM-code or before the Homestead transition. G is fully defined in Appendix G. The up-front cost v0 is calculated as: (65) v0 ≡TgTp + Tv The validity is determined as: (66) S(T) ̸= ∅ ∧ σ[S(T)] ̸= ∅ ∧ Tn = σ[S(T)]n ∧ g0 ⩽ Tg ∧ v0 ⩽ σ[S(T)]b ∧ Tg ⩽ BH l −ℓ(BR)u Note the final condition; the sum of the transaction’s gas limit, Tg, and the gas utilised in this block prior, given by ℓ(BR)u, must be no greater than the block’s gasLimit, BH l. The execution of a valid transaction begins with an irrevocable change made to the state: the nonce of the ac- count of the sender, S(T), is incremented by one and the balance is reduced by part of the up-front cost, TgTp. The gas available for the proceeding computation, g, is defined as Tg −g0. The computation, whether contract creation or a message call, results in an eventual state (which may legally be equivalent to the current state), the change to which is deterministic and never invalid: there can be no invalid transactions from this point. We define the checkpoint state σ0: σ0 ≡ σ except: (67) σ0[S(T)]b ≡ σ[S(T)]b −TgTp (68) σ0[S(T)]n ≡ σ[S(T)]n + 1 (69) Evaluating σP from σ0 depends on the transaction type; either contract creation or message call; we define the tuple of post-execution provisional state σP , remain- ing gas g′ and substate A: (70) (σP , g′, A) ≡ Λ(σ0, S(T), To, g, Tp, Tv, Ti, 0) if Tt = ∅ Θ3(σ0, S(T), To, Tt, Tt, g, Tp, Tv, Tv, Td, 0) otherwise where g is the amount of gas remaining after deducting the basic amount required to pay for the existence of the transaction: (71) g ≡Tg −g0 and To is the original transactor,'},\n",

Contract Creation There are a number of intrinsic parameters used when creating an account: sender (s), original transactor (o), available gas (g), gas price (p), endowment (v) together with an arbitrary length byte array, i, the initialisation EVM code and finally the present depth of the message- call/contract-creation stack (e). We define the creation function formally as the func- tion Λ, which evaluates from these values, together with the state σ to the tuple containing the new state, remain- ing gas and accrued transaction substate (σ′, g′, A), as in section 6: (81) (σ′, g′, A) ≡Λ(σ, s, o, g, p, v, i, e) The address of the new account is defined as being the rightmost 160 bits of the Keccak hash of the RLP encod- ing of the structure containing only the sender and the nonce.

As such, the code execution function Ξ evaluates to a tuple of the resultant state σ∗∗, available gas remaining g∗∗, the ac- crued substate A and the body code of the account o. (87) (σ∗∗, g∗∗, A, o) ≡Ξ(σ∗, g, I) where I contains the parameters of the execution environ- ment as defined in section 9, that is: Ia ≡ a (88) Io ≡ o (89) Ip ≡ p (90) Id ≡ () (91) Is ≡ s (92) Iv ≡ v (93) Ib ≡ i (94) Ie ≡ e (95) Id evaluates to the empty tuple as there is no input data to this call. IH has no special treatment and is de- termined from the blockchain. Code execution depletes gas, and gas may not go below zero, thus execution may exit before the code has come to a natural halting state. In this (and several other) excep- tional cases we say an Out-of-Gas exception has occurred: The evaluated state is defined as being the empty set, ∅, and the entire create operation should have no effect on the state, effectively leaving it as it was immediately prior to attempting the creation. If the initialization code completes successfully, a fi- nal contract-creation cost is paid, the code-deposit cost, c, proportional to the size of the created contract’s code: (96) c ≡Gcodedeposit × |o| If there is not enough gas remaining to pay this, i.e. g∗∗< c, then we also declare an Out-of-Gas exception. The gas remaining will be zero in any such exceptional condition, i.e. if the creation was conducted as the recep- tion of a transaction, then this doesn’t affect payment of the intrinsic cost of contract creation; it is paid regardless. However, the value of the transaction is not transferred to the aborted contract’s address when we are Out-of-Gas. If such an exception does not occur, then the remain- ing gas is refunded'},\n",

However, the value of the transaction is not transferred to the aborted contract’s address when we are Out-of-Gas. If such an exception does not occur, then the remain- ing gas is refunded to the originator and the now-altered state is allowed to persist. Thus formally, we may specify the resultant state, gas and substate as (σ′, g′, A) where: g′ ≡ if σ∗∗= ∅ g∗∗ if g∗∗< c ∧Hi < NH g∗∗−c otherwise (97) σ′ ≡ σ if σ∗∗= ∅ σ∗∗ if g∗∗< c ∧Hi < NH σ∗∗ except: σ′[a]c = KEC(o) otherwise (98) The exception in the determination of σ′ dictates that o, the resultant byte sequence from the execution of the initialisation code, specifies the final body code for the newly-created account. Note that the intention from block NH onwards (Home- stead) is that the result is either a successfully created new contract with its endowment, or no new contract with no transfer of value. Before Homestead, if there is not enough gas to pay c, an account at the new contract’s address is created, along with all the initialisation side-effects, and the value is transferred, but no contract code is deployed. 7.1. Subtleties. Note that while the initialisation code is executing, the newly created address exists but with no intrinsic body code. Thus any message call received by it during this time causes no code to be executed. If the initialisation execution ends with a SUICIDE instruction, the matter is moot since the account will be deleted before the transaction is completed. For a normal STOP code, or if the code returned is otherwise empty, then the state is left with a zombie account, and any remaining balance will be locked into the account forever. 8. Message Call In the case of executing a message call, several param- eters are required: sender (s), transaction originator (o), recipient (r), the account whose code is to be executed (c, usually the same as recipient), available gas (g), value (v) and gas price (p) together with an arbitrary length byte array, d, the input data of the call and finally the present depth of the message-call/contract-creation stack (e). Aside from evaluating to a new state and transaction substate, message calls also have an extra component-the output data denoted by the byte array o. This is ignored when executing transactions, however message calls can be initiated due to VM-code execution and in this case this information is used. (99) (σ′, g′, A, o) ≡Θ(σ, s, o, r, c, g, p, v, ˜v, d, e) Note that we need to differentiate between the value that is to be transferred, v, from the value apparent in the ex- ecution context, ˜v, for the DELEGATECALL instruction.

Just as with contract creation, if the execution halts in an exceptional fashion (i.e. due to an exhausted gas supply, stack underflow, in- valid jump destination or invalid instruction), then no gas is refunded to the caller and the state is reverted to the point immediately prior to balance transfer (i.e. σ). σ′ ≡ ( σ if σ∗∗= ∅ σ∗∗ otherwise (105) (σ∗∗, g′, s, o) ≡ ΞECREC(σ1, g, I) if r = 1 ΞSHA256(σ1, g, I) if r = 2 ΞRIP160(σ1, g, I) if r = 3 ΞID(σ1, g, I) if r = 4 Ξ(σ1, g, I) otherwise (106) Ia ≡ r (107) Io ≡ o (108) Ip ≡ p (109) Id ≡ d (110) Is ≡ s (111) Iv ≡ ˜v (112) Ie ≡ e (113) Let KEC(Ib) = σ[c]c (114) It is assumed that the client will have stored the pair (KEC(Ib), Ib) at some point prior in order to make the de- termination of Ib feasible. As can be seen, there are four exceptions to the usage of the general execution framework Ξ for evaluation of the message call: these are four so-called ‘precompiled’ con- tracts, meant as a preliminary piece of architecture that may later become native extensions. The four contracts in addresses 1, 2, 3 and 4 execute the elliptic curve public key recovery function, the SHA2 256-bit hash scheme, the RIPEMD 160-bit hash scheme and the identity function respectively. Their full formal definition is in Appendix E. 9. Execution Model The execution model specifies how the system state is altered given a series of bytecode instructions and a small tuple of environmental data. This is specified through a formal model of a virtual state machine, known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is a quasi-Turing- complete machine; the quasi qualification comes from the fact that the computation is intrinsically bounded through a parameter, gas, which limits the total amount of com- putation done. 9.1. Basics. The EVM is a simple stack-based architec- ture. The word size of the machine (and thus size of stack item) is 256-bit. This was chosen to facilitate the Keccak- 256 hash scheme and elliptic-curve computations. The memory model is a simple word-addressed byte array. The stack has a maximum size of 1024. The machine also has an independent storage model; this is similar in concept to the memory but rather than a byte array, it is a word- addressable word array. Unlike memory, which is volatile, storage is non volatile and is maintained as part of the system state. All locations in both storage and memory are well-defined initially as zero.

Unlike memory, which is volatile, storage is non volatile and is maintained as part of the system state. All locations in both storage and memory are well-defined initially as zero. The machine does not follow the standard von Neu- mann architecture. Rather than storing program code in generally-accessible memory or storage, it is stored sepa- rately in a virtual ROM interactable only through a spe- cialised instruction. The machine can have exceptional execution for sev- eral reasons, including stack underflows and invalid in- structions. Like the out-of-gas (OOG) exception, they do not leave state changes intact. Rather, the machine halts immediately and reports the issue to the execution agent (either the transaction processor or, recursively, the spawning execution environment) which will deal with it separately. 9.2. Fees Overview. Fees (denominated in gas) are charged under three distinct circumstances, all three as prerequisite to the execution of an operation. The first and most common is the fee intrinsic to the computation of the operation (see Appendix G). Secondly, gas may be deducted in order to form the payment for a subor- dinate message call or contract creation; this forms part of the payment for CREATE, CALL and CALLCODE. Fi- nally, gas may be paid due to an increase in the usage of the memory. Over an account’s execution, the total fee for memory- usage payable is proportional to smallest multiple of 32 bytes that are required such that all memory indices (whether for read or write) are included in the range. This is paid for on a just-in-time basis; as such, referencing an area of memory at least 32 bytes greater than any previ- ously indexed memory will certainly result in an additional memory usage fee. Due to this fee it is highly unlikely addresses will ever go above 32-bit bounds. That said, implementations must be able to manage this eventuality. Storage fees have a slightly nuanced behaviour-to in- centivise minimisation of the use of storage (which corre- sponds directly to a larger state database on all nodes), the execution fee for an operation that clears an entry in the storage is not only waived, a qualified refund is given; in fact, this refund is effectively paid up-front since the initial usage of a storage location costs substantially more than normal usage. See Appendix H for a rigorous definition of the EVM gas cost. 9.3. Execution Environment. In addition to the sys- tem state σ, and the remaining gas for computation g, there are several pieces of important information used in ETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER EIP-150 REVISION the execution environment that the execution agent must provide; these are contained in the tuple I: • Ia, the address of the account which owns the code that is executing. • Io, the sender address of the transaction that orig- inated this execution. • Ip, the price of gas in the transaction that origi- nated this execution. • Id, the byte array that is the input data to this execution; if the execution agent is a transaction, this would be the transaction data. • Is, the address of the account which caused the code to be executing; if the execution agent is a transaction, this would be the transaction sender. •'},\n",

The execution model defines the function Ξ, which can compute the resultant state σ′, the remaining gas g′, the suicide list s, the log series l, the refunds r and the resul- tant output, o, given these definitions: (115) (σ′, g′, s, l, r, o) ≡Ξ(σ, g, I) 9.4. Execution Overview. We must now define the Ξ function. In most practical implementations this will be modelled as an iterative progression of the pair comprising the full system state, σ and the machine state, µ. For- mally, we define it recursively with a function X. This uses an iterator function O (which defines the result of a single cycle of the state machine) together with functions Z which determines if the present state is an exceptional halting state of the machine and H, specifying the output data of the instruction if and only if the present state is a normal halting state of the machine. The empty sequence, denoted (), is not equal to the empty set, denoted ∅; this is important when interpreting the output of H, which evaluates to ∅when execution is to continue but a series (potentially empty) when execution should halt. Ξ(σ, g, I) ≡ X0,1,2,4 (σ, µ, A0, I) (116) µg ≡ g (117) µpc ≡ (118) µm ≡ (0, 0, ...) (119) µi ≡ (120) µs ≡ () (121) (122) X (σ, µ, A, I) ≡ ∅, µ, A0, I, () if Z(σ, µ, I) O(σ, µ, A, I) · o if o ̸= ∅ X O(σ, µ, A, I) otherwise where o ≡ H(µ, I) (123) (a, b, c) · d ≡ (a, b, c, d) (124) Note that we must drop the fourth value in the tuple returned by X to correctly evaluate Ξ, hence the subscript X0,1,2,4. X is thus cycled (recursively here, but implementations are generally expected to use a simple iterative loop) until either Z becomes true indicating that the present state is exceptional and that the machine must be halted and any changes discarded or until H becomes a series (rather than the empty set) indicating that the machine has reached a controlled halt. 9.4.1. Machine State. The machine state µ is defined as the tuple (g, pc, m, i, s) which are the gas available, the program counter pc ∈P256 , the memory contents, the ac- tive number of words in memory (counting continuously from position 0), and the stack contents. The memory contents µm are a series of zeroes of size 2256. For the ease of reading, the instruction mnemonics, written in small-caps (e.g.'},\n",

The memory contents µm are a series of zeroes of size 2256. For the ease of reading, the instruction mnemonics, written in small-caps (e.g. ADD), should be interpreted as their numeric equivalents; the full table of instructions and their specifics is given in Appendix H. For the purposes of defining Z, H and O, we define w as the current operation to be executed: (125) w ≡ ( Ib[µpc] if µpc < ∥Ib∥ STOP otherwise We also assume the fixed amounts of δ and α, specify- ing the stack items removed and added, both subscript- able on the instruction and an instruction cost function C evaluating to the full cost, in gas, of executing the given instruction. 9.4.2. Exceptional Halting. The exceptional halting func- tion Z is defined as: (126) Z(σ, µ, I) ≡ µg < C(σ, µ, I) ∨ δw = ∅ ∨ ∥µs∥< δw ∨ (w ∈{JUMP, JUMPI} ∧ µs[0] /∈D(Ib)) ∨ ∥µs∥−δw + αw > 1024 This states that the execution is in an exceptional halt- ing state if there is insufficient gas, if the instruction is in- valid (and therefore its δ subscript is undefined), if there are insufficient stack items, if a JUMP/JUMPI destination is invalid or the new stack size would be larger then 1024. The astute reader will realise that this implies that no in- struction can, through its execution, cause an exceptional halt. 9.4.3. Jump Destination Validity. We previously used D as the function to determine the set of valid jump desti- nations given the code that is being run. We define this as any position in the code occupied by a JUMPDEST in- struction. All such positions must be on valid instruction bound- aries, rather than sitting in the data portion of PUSH operations and must appear within the explicitly defined portion of the code (rather than in the implicitly defined STOP operations that trail it). Formally: (127) D(c) ≡DJ(c, 0) ETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER EIP-150 REVISION where: (128) DJ(c, i) ≡ {} if i ⩾|c| {i} ∪DJ(c, N(i, c[i])) if c[i] = JUMPDEST DJ(c, N(i, c[i])) otherwise where N is the next valid instruction position in the code, skipping the data of a PUSH instruction, if any: (129) N(i, w) ≡ ( i + w −PUSH1 + 2 if w ∈[PUSH1, PUSH32] i + 1 otherwise 9.4.4. Normal Halting. The normal halting function H is defined: (130) H(µ, I) ≡ HRETURN(µ) if w = RETURN () if w ∈{STOP, SUICIDE} ∅ otherwise The data-returning halt operation, RETURN, has a special function HRETURN, defined in Appendix H. 9.5. The Execution Cycle. Stack items are added or removed from the left-most, lower-indexed portion of the series; all other items remain unchanged: O (σ, µ, A, I) ≡ (σ′, µ′, A′, I) (131) ∆ ≡ αw −δw (132) ∥µ′ s∥ ≡ ∥µs∥+ ∆ (133) ∀x ∈[αw, ∥µ′ s∥) : µ′ s[x] ≡ µs[x + ∆] (134) The gas is reduced by the instruction’s gas cost and for most instructions, the program counter increments on each cycle, for the three exceptions, we assume a function J, subscripted by one of two instructions, which evaluates to'},\n",

Altered components listed by instruction are noted in Appendix H, alongside values for α and δ and a formal description of the gas requirements. 10. Blocktree to Blockchain The canonical blockchain is a path from root to leaf through the entire block tree. In order to have consensus over which path it is, conceptually we identify the path that has had the most computation done upon it, or, the heaviest path. Clearly one factor that helps determine the heaviest path is the block number of the leaf, equivalent to the number of blocks, not counting the unmined genesis block, in the path. The longer the path, the greater the total mining effort that must have been done in order to arrive at the leaf. This is akin to existing schemes, such as that employed in Bitcoin-derived protocols. Since a block header includes the difficulty, the header alone is enough to validate the computation done. Any block contributes toward the total computation or total difficulty of a chain. Thus we define the total difficulty of block B recur- sively as: Bt ≡ B′ t + Bd (141) B′ ≡ P(BH) (142) As such given a block B, Bt is its total difficulty, B′ is its parent block and Bd is its difficulty. 11. Block Finalisation The process of finalising a block involves four stages: (1) Validate (or, if mining, determine) ommers; (2) validate (or, if mining, determine) transactions; (3) apply rewards; (4) verify (or, if mining, compute a valid) state and nonce. 11.1. Ommer Validation. The validation of ommer headers means nothing more than verifying that each om- mer header is both a valid header and satisfies the rela- tion of Nth-generation ommer to the present block where N ≤6. The maximum of ommer headers is two. Formally: (143) ∥BU∥⩽2 ^ U∈BU V (U) ∧k(U, P(BH)H, 6) where k denotes the “is-kin” property: (144) k(U, H, n) ≡ false if n = 0 s(U, H) ∨k(U, P(H)H, n −1) otherwise and s denotes the “is-sibling” property: (145) s(U, H) ≡(P(H) = P(U) ∧H ̸= U ∧U /∈B(H)U) where B(H) is the block of the corresponding header H. 11.2. Transaction Validation. The given gasUsed must correspond faithfully to the transactions listed: BH g, the total gas used in the block, must be equal to the ac- cumulated gas used according to the final transaction: (146) BH g = ℓ(R)u 11.3.

Reward Application. The application of rewards to a block involves raising the balance of the accounts of the beneficiary address of the block and each ommer by a certain amount. We raise the block’s beneficiary account by Rb; for each ommer, we raise the block’s beneficiary by an additional 32 of the block reward and the beneficiary of the ommer gets rewarded depending on the block number. Formally we define the function Ω: Ω(B, σ) ≡ σ′ : σ′ = σ except: (147) σ′[BH c]b = σ[BH c]b + (1 + ∥BU∥ )Rb (148) ∀U∈BU : (149) σ′[Uc]b = σ[Uc]b + (1 + 1 8(Ui −BH i))Rb If there are collisions of the beneficiary addresses be- tween ommers and the block (i.e. two ommers with the ETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER EIP-150 REVISION same beneficiary address or an ommer with the same bene- ficiary address as the present block), additions are applied cumulatively. We define the block reward as 5 Ether: (150) Let Rb = 5 × 1018 11.4. State & Nonce Validation. We may now define the function, Γ, that maps a block B to its initiation state: (151) Γ(B) ≡ ( σ0 if P(BH) = ∅ σi : TRIE(LS(σi)) = P(BH)H r otherwise Here, TRIE(LS(σi)) means the hash of the root node of a trie of state σi; it is assumed that implementations will store this in the state database, trivial and efficient since the trie is by nature an immutable data structure. And finally define Φ, the block transition function, which maps an incomplete block B to a complete block B′: Φ(B) ≡ B′ : B′ = B∗ except: (152) B′ n = n : x ⩽2256 Hd (153) B′ m = m with (x, m) = PoW(B∗n, n, d) (154) B∗ ≡ B except: B∗ r = r(Π(Γ(B), B)) (155) With d being a dataset as specified in appendix J. As specified at the beginning of the present work, Π is the state-transition function, which is defined in terms of Ω, the block finalisation function and Υ, the transaction- evaluation function, both now well-defined. As previously detailed, R[n]σ, R[n]l and R[n]u are the nth corresponding states, logs and cumulative gas used af- ter each transaction (R[n]b, the fourth component in the tuple, has already been defined in terms of the logs). The former is defined simply as the state resulting from apply- ing the corresponding transaction to the state resulting from the previous transaction (or the block’s initial state in the case of the first such transaction): (156) R[n]σ = ( Γ(B) if n < 0 Υ(R[n −1]σ, BT[n]) otherwise In the case of BR[n]u, we take a similar approach defin- ing each item as the gas used in evaluating the correspond- ing transaction summed with the previous item (or zero, if it is the first), giving us a running total: (157) R[n]u = if n < 0 Υg(R[n −1]σ, BT[n]) +R[n −1]u otherwise For R[n]l, we utilise the Υl function that we conve- niently defined in the transaction execution function.

Mining Proof-of-Work. The mining proof-of- work (PoW) exists as a cryptographically secure nonce that proves beyond reasonable doubt that a particular amount of computation has been expended in the deter- mination of some token value n. It is utilised to enforce the blockchain security by giving meaning and credence to the notion of difficulty (and, by extension, total dif- ficulty). However, since mining new blocks comes with an attached reward, the proof-of-work not only functions as a method of securing confidence that the blockchain will remain canonical into the future, but also as a wealth distribution mechanism. For both reasons, there are two important goals of the proof-of-work function; firstly, it should be as accessible as possible to as many people as possible. The requirement of, or reward from, specialised and uncommon hardware should be minimised. This makes the distribution model as open as possible, and, ideally, makes the act of mining a simple swap from electricity to Ether at roughly the same rate for anyone around the world. Secondly, it should not be possible to make super-linear profits, and especially not so with a high initial barrier. Such a mechanism allows a well-funded adversary to gain a troublesome amount of the network’s total mining power and as such gives them a super-linear reward (thus skew- ing distribution in their favour) as well as reducing the network security. One plague of the Bitcoin world is ASICs. These are specialised pieces of compute hardware that exist only to do a single task. In Bitcoin’s case the task is the SHA256 hash function. While ASICs exist for a proof-of-work func- tion, both goals are placed in jeopardy. Because of this, a proof-of-work function that is ASIC-resistant (i.e. diffi- cult or economically inefficient to implement in specialised compute hardware) has been identified as the proverbial silver bullet. Two directions exist for ASIC resistance; firstly make it sequential memory-hard, i.e. engineer the function such that the determination of the nonce requires a lot of mem- ory and bandwidth such that the memory cannot be used in parallel to discover multiple nonces simultaneously. The second is to make the type of computation it would need to do general-purpose; the meaning of “specialised hard- ware” for a general-purpose task set is, naturally, general purpose hardware and as such commodity desktop com- puters are likely to be pretty close to “specialised hard- ware” for the task. For Ethereum 1.0 we have chosen the first path. More formally, the proof-of-work function takes the form of PoW: (160) m = Hm ∧ n ⩽2256 Hd with (m, n) = PoW(Hn, Hn, d) Where Hn is the new block’s header but without the nonce and mix-hash components; Hn is the nonce of the header; d is a large data set needed to compute the mix- Hash and Hd is the new block’s difficulty value (i.e. the block'},\n",

PoW is the proof-of-work function which evaluates to an array with the first item being the mixHash and the second item being a pseudo- random number cryptographically dependent on H and d. The underlying algorithm is called Ethash and is described below. ETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER EIP-150 REVISION 11.5.1. Ethash. Ethash is the planned PoW algorithm for Ethereum 1.0. It is the latest version of Dagger- Hashimoto, introduced by Buterin [2013b] and Dryja [2014], although it can no longer appropriately be called that since many of the original features of both algorithms have been drastically changed in the last month of research and development. The general route that the algorithm takes is as follows: There exists a seed which can be computed for each block by scanning through the block headers up until that point. From the seed, one can compute a pseudorandom cache, Jcacheinit bytes in initial size. Light clients store the cache. From the cache, we can generate a dataset, Jdatasetinit bytes in initial size, with the property that each item in the dataset depends on only a small number of items from the cache. Full clients and miners store the dataset. The dataset grows linearly with time. Mining involves grabbing random slices of the dataset and hashing them together. Verification can be done with low memory by using the cache to regenerate the specific pieces of the dataset that you need, so you only need to store the cache. The large dataset is updated once ev- ery Jepoch blocks, so the vast majority of a miner’s effort will be reading the dataset, not making changes to it. The mentioned parameters as well as the algorithm is explained in detail in appendix J. 12. Implementing Contracts There are several patterns of contracts engineering that allow particular useful behaviours; two of these that I will briefly discuss are data feeds and random numbers. 12.1. Data Feeds. A data feed contract is one which pro- vides a single service: it gives access to information from the external world within Ethereum. The accuracy and timeliness of this information is not guaranteed and it is the task of a secondary contract author-the contract that utilises the data feed-to determine how much trust can be placed in any single data feed. The general pattern involves a single contract within Ethereum which, when given a message call, replies with some timely information concerning an external phenom- enon. An example might be the local temperature of New York City. This would be implemented as a contract that returned that value of some known point in storage. Of course this point in storage must be maintained with the correct such temperature, and thus the second part of the pattern would be for an external server to run an Ethereum node, and immediately on discovery of a new block, creates a new valid transaction, sent to the contract, updating said value in storage. The contract’s code would accept such updates'},\n",

The contract’s code would accept such updates only from the identity contained on said server. 12.2. Random Numbers. Providing random numbers within a deterministic system is, naturally, an impossible task. However, we can approximate with pseudo-random numbers by utilising data which is generally unknowable at the time of transacting. Such data might include the block’s hash, the block’s timestamp and the block’s benefi- ciary address. In order to make it hard for malicious miner to control those values, one should use the BLOCKHASH operation in order to use hashes of the previous 256 blocks as pseudo-random numbers. For a series of such numbers, a trivial solution would be to add some constant amount and hashing the result. 13. Future Directions The state database won’t be forced to maintain all past state trie structures into the future. It should maintain an age for each node and eventually discard nodes that are neither recent enough nor checkpoints; checkpoints, or a set of nodes in the database that allow a particular block’s state trie to be traversed, could be used to place a maxi- mum limit on the amount of computation needed in order to retrieve any state throughout the blockchain. Blockchain consolidation could be used in order to re- duce the amount of blocks a client would need to download to act as a full, mining, node. A compressed archive of the trie structure at given points in time (perhaps one in every 10,000th block) could be maintained by the peer network, effectively recasting the genesis block. This would reduce the amount to be downloaded to a single archive plus a hard maximum limit of blocks. Finally, blockchain compression could perhaps be con- ducted: nodes in state trie that haven’t sent/received a transaction in some constant amount of blocks could be thrown out, reducing both Ether-leakage and the growth of the state database. 13.1. Scalability. Scalability remains an eternal con- cern. With a generalised state transition function, it be- comes difficult to partition and parallelise transactions to apply the divide-and-conquer strategy. Unaddressed, the dynamic value-range of the system remains essentially fixed and as the average transaction value increases, the less valuable of them become ignored, being economically pointless to include in the main ledger. However, several strategies exist that may potentially be exploited to pro- vide a considerably more scalable protocol. Some form of hierarchical structure, achieved by ei- ther consolidating smaller lighter-weight chains into the main block or building the main block through the in- cremental combination and adhesion (through proof-of- work) of smaller transaction sets may allow parallelisa- tion of transaction combination and block-building. Par- allelism could also come from a prioritised set of parallel blockchains, consolidated each block and with duplicate or invalid transactions thrown out accordingly. Finally, verifiable computation, if made generally avail- able and efficient enough, may provide a route to allow the proof-of-work to be the verification of final state. 14.

Though homogenous, it makes sense to distinguish between two practical types of account: those with empty associated EVM Code (thus the account balance is controlled, if at all, by some external entity) and those with non-empty associated EVM Code (thus the account represents an Autonomous Object). Each Account has a single Address that identifies it. Transaction: A piece of data, signed by an External Actor. It represents either a Message or a new Autonomous Object. Transactions are recorded into each block of the blockchain. Autonomous Object: A notional object existent only within the hypothetical state of Ethereum. Has an intrinsic address and thus an associated account; the account will have non-empty associated EVM Code. Incorporated only as the Storage State of that account. Storage State: The information particular to a given Account that is maintained between the times that the Account’s associated EVM Code runs. Message: Data (as a set of bytes) and Value (specified as Ether) that is passed between two Accounts, either through the deterministic operation of an Autonomous Object or the cryptographically secure signature of the Transaction. Message Call: The act of passing a message from one Account to another. If the destination account is associated with non-empty EVM Code, then the VM will be started with the state of said Object and the Message acted upon. If the message sender is an Autonomous Object, then the Call passes any data returned from the VM operation. Gas: The fundamental network cost unit. Paid for exclusively by Ether (as of PoC-4), which is converted freely to and from Gas as required. Gas does not exist outside of the internal Ethereum computation engine; its price is set by the Transaction and miners are free to ignore Transactions whose Gas price is too low. Contract: Informal term used to mean both a piece of EVM Code that may be associated with an Account or an Autonomous Object. Object: Synonym for Autonomous Object.

Recursive Length Prefix This is a serialisation method for encoding arbitrarily structured binary data (byte arrays). We define the set of possible structures T: T ≡ L ∪B (161) L ≡ {t : t = (t[0], t[1], ...) ∧∀n<∥t∥t[n] ∈T} (162) B ≡ {b : b = (b[0], b[1], ...) ∧∀n<∥b∥b[n] ∈O} (163) Where O is the set of bytes. Thus B is the set of all sequences of bytes (otherwise known as byte-arrays, and a leaf if imagined as a tree), L is the set of all tree-like (sub-)structures that are not a single leaf (a branch node if imagined as a tree) and T is the set of all byte-arrays and such structural sequences. We define the RLP function as RLP through two sub-functions, the first handling the instance when the value is a byte array, the second when it is a sequence of further values: (164) RLP(x) ≡ ( Rb(x) if x ∈B Rl(x) otherwise If the value to be serialised is a byte-array, the RLP serialisation takes one of three forms: • If the byte-array contains solely a single byte and that single byte is less than 128, then the input is exactly equal to the output. • If the byte-array contains fewer than 56 bytes, then the output is equal to the input prefixed by the byte equal to the length of the byte array plus 128. • Otherwise, the output is equal to the input prefixed by the minimal-length byte-array which when interpreted as a big-endian integer is equal to the length of the input byte array, which is itself prefixed by the number of bytes required to faithfully encode this length value plus 183. Formally, we define Rb: Rb(x) ≡ x if ∥x∥= 1 ∧x[0] < 128 (128 + ∥x∥) · x else if ∥x∥< 56 183 + BE(∥x∥) · BE(∥x∥) · x otherwise (165) BE(x) ≡ (b0, b1, ...) : b0 ̸= 0 ∧x = n<∥b∥ X n=0 bn · 256∥b∥−1−n (166) (a) · (b, c) · (d, e) = (a, b, c, d, e) (167) Thus BE is the function that expands a positive integer value to a big-endian byte array of minimal length and the dot operator performs sequence concatenation. If instead, the value to be serialised is a sequence of other items then the RLP serialisation takes one of two forms: • If the concatenated serialisations of each contained item is less than 56 bytes in length, then the output is equal to that concatenation prefixed by the byte equal to the length of this byte array plus 192. • Otherwise, the output is equal to the concatenated serialisations prefixed by the minimal-length byte-array which when interpreted as a big-endian integer is equal to the length of the concatenated serialisations byte array, which is itself prefixed by the number of bytes required to faithfully encode this length value plus 247. Thus we finish by formally defining Rl: Rl(x) ≡ ( (192 + ∥s(x)∥) · s(x) if ∥s(x)∥< 56 247 + BE(∥s(x)∥) · BE(∥s(x)∥) · s(x) otherwise (168) s(x) ≡ RLP(x0) · RLP(x1)...

(169) ETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER EIP-150 REVISION If RLP is used to encode a scalar, defined only as a positive integer (P or any x for Px), it must be specified as the shortest byte array such that the big-endian interpretation of it is equal. Thus the RLP of some positive integer i is defined as: (170) RLP(i : i ∈P) ≡RLP(BE(i)) When interpreting RLP data, if an expected fragment is decoded as a scalar and leading zeroes are found in the byte sequence, clients are required to consider it non-canonical and treat it in the same manner as otherwise invalid RLP data, dismissing it completely. There is no specific canonical encoding format for signed or floating-point values. Appendix C. Hex-Prefix Encoding Hex-prefix encoding is an efficient method of encoding an arbitrary number of nibbles as a byte array. It is able to store an additional flag which, when used in the context of the trie (the only context in which it is used), disambiguates between node types. It is defined as the function HP which maps from a sequence of nibbles (represented by the set Y) together with a boolean value to a sequence of bytes (represented by the set B): HP(x, t) : x ∈Y ≡ ( (16f(t), 16x[0] + x[1], 16x[2] + x[3], ...) if ∥x∥is even (16(f(t) + 1) + x[0], 16x[1] + x[2], 16x[3] + x[4], ...) otherwise (171) f(t) ≡ ( if t ̸= 0 otherwise (172) Thus the high nibble of the first byte contains two flags; the lowest bit encoding the oddness of the length and the second-lowest encoding the flag t. The low nibble of the first byte is zero in the case of an even number of nibbles and the first nibble in the case of an odd number. All remaining nibbles (now an even number) fit properly into the remaining bytes. Appendix D. Modified Merkle Patricia Tree The modified Merkle Patricia tree (trie) provides a persistent data structure to map between arbitrary-length binary data (byte arrays). It is defined in terms of a mutable data structure to map between 256-bit binary fragments and arbitrary-length binary data, typically implemented as a database. The core of the trie, and its sole requirement in terms of the protocol specification is to provide a single value that identifies a given set of key-value pairs, which may be either a 32 byte sequence or the empty byte sequence. It is left as an implementation consideration to store and maintain the structure of the trie in a manner the allows effective and efficient realisation of the protocol. Formally, we assume the input value I, a set containing pairs of byte sequences: (173) I = {(k0 ∈B, v0 ∈B), (k1 ∈B, v1 ∈B), ...} When considering such a sequence, we use the common numeric subscript notation to refer to a tuple’s key or value, thus: (174) ∀I∈II ≡(I0, I1) Any series of bytes may also trivially be viewed as a series of nibbles, given an endian-specific notation; here we assume big-endian.

Thus: y(I) = {(k′ 0 ∈Y, v0 ∈B), (k′ 1 ∈Y, v1 ∈B), ...} (175) ∀n ∀i:i<2∥kn∥ k′ n[i] ≡ ( ⌊kn[i ÷ 2] ÷ 16⌋ if i is even kn[⌊i ÷ 2⌋] mod 16 otherwise (176) We define the function TRIE, which evaluates to the root of the trie that represents this set when encoded in this structure: (177) TRIE(I) ≡KEC(c(I, 0)) We also assume a function n, the trie’s node cap function. When composing a node, we use RLP to encode the structure. As a means of reducing storage complexity, for nodes whose composed RLP is fewer than 32 bytes, we store the RLP directly; for those larger we assert prescience of the byte array whose Keccak hash evaluates to our reference. Thus we define in terms of c, the node composition function: (178) n(I, i) ≡ () if I = ∅ c(I, i) if ∥c(I, i)∥< 32 KEC(c(I, i)) otherwise In a manner similar to a radix tree, when the trie is traversed from root to leaf, one may build a single key-value pair. The key is accumulated through the traversal, acquiring a single nibble from each branch node (just as with a radix tree). Unlike a radix tree, in the case of multiple keys sharing the same prefix or in the case of a single key having ETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER EIP-150 REVISION a unique suffix, two optimising nodes are provided. Thus while traversing, one may potentially acquire multiple nibbles from each of the other two node types, extension and leaf. There are three kinds of nodes in the trie: Leaf: A two-item structure whose first item corresponds to the nibbles in the key not already accounted for by the accumulation of keys and branches traversed from the root. The hex-prefix encoding method is used and the second parameter to the function is required to be true. Extension: A two-item structure whose first item corresponds to a series of nibbles of size greater than one that are shared by at least two distinct keys past the accumulation of nibbles keys and branches as traversed from the root. The hex-prefix encoding method is used and the second parameter to the function is required to be false. Branch: A 17-item structure whose first sixteen items correspond to each of the sixteen possible nibble values for the keys at this point in their traversal. The 17th item is used in the case of this being a terminator node and thus a key being ended at this point in its traversal. A branch is then only used when necessary; no branch nodes may exist that contain only a single non-zero entry. We may formally define this structure with the structural composition function c: (179) c(I, i) ≡ RLP HP(I0[i..(∥I0∥−1)], true), I1 if ∥I∥= 1 where ∃I : I ∈I RLP HP(I0[i..(j −1)], false), n(I, j) if i ̸= j where j = arg maxx : ∃l : ∥l∥= x : ∀I∈I : I0[0..(x −1)] = l RLP (u(0), u(1), ..., u(15), v) otherwise where u(j) ≡ n({I : I'},\n",

Trie Database. Thus no explicit assumptions are made concerning what data is stored and what is not, since that is an implementation-specific consideration; we simply define the identity function mapping the key-value set I to a 32-byte hash and assert that only a single such hash exists for any I, which though not strictly true is accurate within acceptable precision given the Keccak hash’s collision resistance. In reality, a sensible implementation will not fully recompute the trie root hash for each set. A reasonable implementation will maintain a database of nodes determined from the computation of various tries or, more formally, it will memoise the function c. This strategy uses the nature of the trie to both easily recall the contents of any previous key-value set and to store multiple such sets in a very efficient manner. Due to the dependency relationship, Merkle-proofs may be constructed with an O(log N) space requirement that can demonstrate a particular leaf must exist within a trie of a given root hash. Appendix E. Precompiled Contracts For each precompiled contract, we make use of a template function, ΞPRE, which implements the out-of-gas checking. (180) ΞPRE(σ, g, I) ≡ ( (∅, 0, A0, ()) if g < gr (σ, g −gr, A0, o) otherwise The precompiled contracts each use these definitions and provide specifications for the o (the output data) and gr, the gas requirements. For the elliptic curve DSA recover VM execution function, we also define d to be the input data, well-defined for an infinite length by appending zeroes as required. Importantly in the case of an invalid signature (ECDSARECOVER(h, v, r, s) = ∅), then we have no output. ΞECREC ≡ ΞPRE where: (181) gr = (182) |o| = ( if ECDSARECOVER(h, v, r, s) = ∅ otherwise (183) if |o| = 32 : (184) o[0..11] = (185) o[12..31] = KEC ECDSARECOVER(h, v, r, s) [12..31] where: (186) d[0..(|Id| −1)] = Id (187) d[|Id|..] = (0, 0, ...)

Signing Transactions The method of signing transactions is similar to the ‘Electrum style signatures’; it utilises the SECP-256k1 curve as described by Gura et al. [2004]. It is assumed that the sender has a valid private key pr, which is a randomly selected positive integer (represented as a byte array of length 32 in big-endian form) in the range [1, secp256k1n −1]. We assert the functions ECDSASIGN, ECDSARESTORE and ECDSAPUBKEY. These are formally defined in the literature. ECDSAPUBKEY(pr ∈B32) ≡ pu ∈B64 (206) ECDSASIGN(e ∈B32, pr ∈B32) ≡ (v ∈B1, r ∈B32, s ∈B32) (207) ECDSARECOVER(e ∈B32, v ∈B1, r ∈B32, s ∈B32) ≡ pu ∈B64 (208) Where pu is the public key, assumed to be a byte array of size 64 (formed from the concatenation of two positive integers each < 2256) and pr is the private key, a byte array of size 32 (or a single positive integer in the aforementioned range). It is assumed that v is the ‘recovery id’, a 1 byte value specifying the sign and finiteness of the curve point; this value is in the range of [27, 30], however we declare the upper two possibilities, representing infinite values, invalid. We declare that a signature is invalid unless all the following conditions are true: 0 < r < secp256k1n (209) 0 < s < secp256k1n if Hi < NH secp256k1n ÷ 2 otherwise (210) v ∈{27, 28} (211) where: secp256k1n = 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337 (212) For a given private key, pr, the Ethereum address A(pr) (a 160-bit value) to which it corresponds is defined as the right most 160-bits of the Keccak hash of the corresponding ECDSA public key: (213) A(pr) = B96..255 KEC ECDSAPUBKEY(pr) The message hash, h(T), to be signed is the Keccak hash of the transaction without the latter three signature components, formally described as Tr, Ts and Tw: LS(T) ≡ ( (Tn, Tp, Tg, Tt, Tv, Ti) if Tt = 0 (Tn, Tp, Tg, Tt, Tv, Td) otherwise (214) h(T) ≡ KEC(LS(T)) (215) The signed transaction G(T, pr) is defined as: G(T, pr) ≡T except: (216) (Tw, Tr, Ts) = ECDSASIGN(h(T), pr) (217) ETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER EIP-150 REVISION We may then define the sender function S of the transaction as: (218) S(T) ≡B96..255 KEC ECDSARECOVER(h(T), Tw, Tr, Ts) The assertion that the sender of the a signed transaction equals the address of the signer should be self-evident: (219) ∀T : ∀pr : S(G(T, pr)) ≡A(pr) Appendix G.

When a 256-bit machine datum is converted to and from a 160-bit address or hash, the rightwards (low-order for BE) 20 bytes are used and the left most 12 are discarded or filled with zeroes, thus the integer values (when the bytes are interpreted as big-endian) are equivalent.

Such accesses must be for non-zero number of bytes. Referencing a zero length range (e.g. by attempting to pass it as the input range to a CALL) does not require memory to be extended to the beginning of the range. µ′ i is defined as this new maximum number of words of active memory; special-cases are given where these two are not equal. Note also that Cmem is the memory cost function (the expansion function being the difference between the cost before and after). It is a polynomial, with the higher-order coefficient divided and floored, and thus linear up to 724B of memory used, after which it costs substantially more.

We employ the following definitions: Name Value Description Jwordbytes Bytes in word. Jdatasetinit Bytes in dataset at genesis. Jdatasetgrowth Dataset growth per epoch. Jcacheinit Bytes in cache at genesis. Jcachegrowth Cache growth per epoch. Jepoch Blocks per epoch. Jmixbytes mix length in bytes. Jhashbytes Hash length in bytes. Jparents Number of parents of each dataset element. Jcacherounds Number of rounds in cache production. Jaccesses Number of accesses in hashimoto loop. J.2. Size of dataset and cache. The size for Ethash’s cache c ∈B and dataset d ∈B depend on the epoch, which in turn depends on the block number. (227) Eepoch(Hi) = Hi Jepoch The size of the dataset growth by Jdatasetgrowth bytes, and the size of the cache by Jcachegrowth bytes, every epoch. In order to avoid regularity leading to cyclic behavior, the size must be a prime number. Therefore the size is reduced by ETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER EIP-150 REVISION a multiple of Jmixbytes, for the dataset, and Jhashbytes for the cache. Let dsize = ∥d∥be the size of the dataset. Which is calculated using (228) dsize = Eprime(Jdatasetinit + Jdatasetgrowth · Eepoch −Jmixbytes, Jmixbytes) The size of the cache, csize, is calculated using (229) csize = Eprime(Jcacheinit + Jcachegrowth · Eepoch −Jhashbytes, Jhashbytes) (230) Eprime(x, y) = ( x if x/y ∈P Eprime(x −1 · y, y) otherwise J.3.

J.3.2. Cache. The cache production process involves using the seed hash to first sequentially filling up csize bytes of memory, then performing Jcacherounds passes of the RandMemoHash algorithm created by Lerner [2014]. The intial cache c′, being an array of arrays of single bytes, will be constructed as follows. We define the array ci, consisting of 64 single bytes, as the ith element of the intial cache: (233) ci = ( KEC512(s) if i = 0 KEC512(ci−1) otherwise Therefore c′ can be defined as (234) c′[i] = ci ∀ i < n (235) n = csize Jhashbytes The cache is calculated by performing Jcacherounds rounds of the RandMemoHash algorithm to the inital cache c′: (236) c = Ecacherounds(c′, Jcacherounds) (237) Ecacherounds(x, y) = x if y = 0 ERMH(x) if y = 1 Ecacherounds(ERMH(x), y −1) otherwise Where a single round modifies each subset of the cache as follows: (238) ERMH(x) = Ermh(x, 0), Ermh(x, 1), ..., Ermh(x, n −1) (239) Ermh(x, i) = KEC512(x′[(i −1 + n) mod n] ⊕x′[x′[i][0] mod n]) with x′ = x except x′[j] = Ermh(x, j) ∀ j < i J.3.3. Full dataset calculation. Essentially, we combine data from Jparents pseudorandomly selected cache nodes, and hash that to compute the dataset. The entire dataset is then generated by a number of items, each Jhashbytes bytes in size: (240) d[i] = Edatasetitem(c, i) ∀ i < dsize Jhashbytes In order to calculate the single item we use an algorithm inspired by the FNV hash (Glenn Fowler [1991]) in some cases as a non-associative substitute for XOR. (241) EFNV(x, y) = (x · (0x01000193 ⊕y)) mod 232 The single item of the dataset can now be calculated as: (242) Edatasetitem(c, i) = Eparents(c, i, −1, ∅) (243) Eparents(c, i, p, m) = ( Eparents(c, i, p + 1, Emix(m, c, i, p + 1)) if p < Jparents −2 Emix(m, c, i, p + 1) otherwise ETHEREUM: A SECURE DECENTRALISED GENERALISED TRANSACTION LEDGER EIP-150 REVISION (244) Emix(m, c, i, p) = ( KEC512(c[i mod csize] ⊕i) if p = 0 EFNV m, c[EFNV(i ⊕p, m[p mod ⌊Jhashbytes/Jwordbytes⌋]) mod csize] otherwise J.4. Proof-of-work function. Essentially, we maintain a ”mix” Jmixbytes bytes wide, and repeatedly sequentially fetch Jmixbytes bytes from the full dataset and use the EFNV function to combine it with the mix. Jmixbytes bytes of sequential access are used so that each round of the algorithm always fetches a full page from RAM, minimizing translation lookaside buffer misses which ASICs would theoretically be able to avoid. If the output of this algorithm is below the desired target, then the nonce is valid.

Abstract This paper proposes a new blockchain architecture based on Proof of History (PoH) - a proof for verifying order and passage of time between events. PoH is used to encode trustless passage of time into a ledger - an append only data structure. When used alongside a consensus algorithm such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), PoH can reduce messaging overhead in a Byzantine Fault Tol- erant replicated state machine, resulting inn sub-second finality times. This paper also proposes two algorithms that leverage the time keep- ing properties of the PoH ledger - a PoS algorithm that can recover from partitions of any size and an efficient streaming Proof of Replica- tion (PoRep). The combination of PoRep and PoH provides a defense against forgery of the ledger with respect to time (ordering) and stor- age. The protocol is analyzed on a 1 gbps network, and this paper shows that throughput up to 710k transactions per second is possible with todays hardware. 1 Introduction Blockchain is an implementation of a fault tolerant replicated state machine. Current publicly available blockchains do not rely on time, or make a weak assumption about the participants abilities to keep time [4, 5]. Each node in the network usually relies on their own local clock without knowledge of any other participants clocks in the network. The lack of a trusted source of time means that when a message timestamp is used to accept or reject a message, there is no guarantee that every other participant in the network will make the exact same choice. The PoH presented here is designed to create a ledger with verifiable passage of time, i.e. duration between events and message ordering. It is anticipated that every node in the network will be able to rely on the recorded passage of time in the ledger without trust. Outline The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Overall system design is described in Section 3. In depth description of Proof of History is described in Section 4. In depth description of the proposed Proof of Stake consensus algorithm is described in Section 5. In depth description of the proposed fast Proof of Replication is described in Section 6.

System Architecture and performance limits are analyzed in Section 7. A high performance GPU friendly smart contracts engine is described in Section 7.5 Network Design As shown in Figure 1, at any given time a system node is designated as Leader to generate a Proof of History sequence, providing the network global read consistency and a verifiable passage of time. The Leader sequences user messages and orders them such that they can be efficiently processed by other nodes in the system, maximizing throughput. It executes the transactions on the current state that is stored in RAM and publishes the transactions and a signature of the final state to the replications nodes called Verifiers. Verifiers execute the same transactions on their copies of the state, and pub- lish their computed signatures of the state as confirmations. The published confirmations serve as votes for the consensus algorithm. Figure 1: Transaction flow throughout the network. In a non-partitioned state, at any given time, there is one Leader in the network. Each Verifier node has the same hardware capabilities as a Leader and can be elected as a Leader, this is done through PoS based elections. Elections for the proposed PoS algorithm are covered in depth in Section 5.6. In terms of CAP theorem, Consistency is almost always picked over Avail- ability in an event of a Partition. In case of a large partition, this paper proposes a mechanism to recover control of the network from a partition of any size. This is covered in depth in Section 5.12. Proof of History Proof of History is a sequence of computation that can provide a way to cryptographically verify passage of time between two events. It uses a cryp- tographically secure function written so that output cannot be predicted from the input, and must be completely executed to generate the output. The function is run in a sequence on a single core, its previous output as the current input, periodically recording the current output, and how many times its been called. The output can then be re-computed and verified by external computers in parallel by checking each sequence segment on a separate core. Data can be timestamped into this sequence by appending the data (or a hash of some data) into the state of the function. The recording of the state, index and data as it was appended into the sequences provides a timestamp that can guarantee that the data was created sometime before the next hash was generated in the sequence. This design also supports horizontal scaling as multiple generators can synchronize amongst each other by mixing their state into each others sequences. Horizontal scaling is discussed in depth in Section 4.4 4.1 Description The system is designed to work as follows. With a cryptographic hash func- tion, whose output cannot be predicted without running the function (e.g. sha256, ripemd, etc.), run the function from some random starting value and take its output and pass it as the input into the same function again.

Record the number of times the function has been called and the output at each call. The starting random value chosen could be any string, like the headline of the New York times for the day. For example: PoH Sequence Index Operation Output Hash sha256(”any random starting value”) hash1 sha256(hash1) hash2 sha256(hash2) hash3 Where hashN represents the actual hash output. It is only necessary to publish a subset of the hashes and indices at an interval. For example: PoH Sequence Index Operation Output Hash sha256(”any random starting value”) hash1 sha256(hash199) hash200 sha256(hash299) hash300 As long as the hash function chosen is collision resistant, this set of hashes can only be computed in sequence by a single computer thread. This follows from the fact that there is no way to predict what the hash value at index 300 is going to be without actually running the algorithm from the starting value 300 times. Thus we can thus infer from the data structure that real time has passed between index 0 and index 300. In the example in Figure 2, hash 62f51643c1 was produced on count 510144806912 and hash c43d862d88 was produced on count 510146904064. Following the previously discussed properties of the PoH algorithm, we can trust that real time passed between count 510144806912 and count 510146904064. Figure 2: Proof of History sequence 4.2 Timestamp for Events This sequence of hashes can also be used to record that some piece of data was created before a particular hash index was generated. Using a ‘combine‘ function to combine the piece of data with the current hash at the current index. The data can simply be a cryptographically unique hash of arbitrary event data. The combine function can be a simple append of data, or any operation that is collision resistant. The next generated hash represents a timestamp of the data, because it could have only been generated after that specific piece of data was inserted. For example: PoH Sequence Index Operation Output Hash sha256(”any random starting value”) hash1 sha256(hash199) hash200 sha256(hash299) hash300 Some external event occurs, like a photograph was taken, or any arbitrary digital data was created: PoH Sequence With Data Index Operation Output Hash sha256(”any random starting value”) hash1 sha256(hash199) hash200 sha256(hash299) hash300 sha256(append(hash335, photograph sha256)) hash336 Hash336 is computed from the appended binary data of hash335 and the sha256 of the photograph. The index and the sha256 of the photograph are recorded as part of the sequence output. So anyone verifying this sequence can then recreate this change to the sequence. The verifying can still be done in parallel and its discussed in Section 4.3 Because the initial process is still sequential, we can then tell that things entered into the sequence must have occurred sometime before the future hashed value was computed.

Inserting the data into the sequence of hashes results in a change to all subsequent values in the sequence. As long as the hash function used is collision resistant, and the data was appended, it should be computationally impossible to pre-compute any future sequences based on prior knowledge of what data will be inte- grated into the sequence. The data that is mixed into the sequence can be the raw data itself, or just a hash of the data with accompanying metadata. In the example in Figure 3, input cfd40df8... was inserted into the Proof of History sequence. The count at which it was inserted is 510145855488 and the state at which it was inserted it is 3d039eef3. All the future gen- erated hashes are modified by this change to the sequence, this change is indicated by the color change in the figure. Every node observing this sequence can determine the order at which all events have been inserted and estimate the real time between the insertions. Figure 3: Inserting data into Proof of History 4.3 Verification The sequence can be verified correct by a multicore computer in significantly less time than it took to generate it. For example: Core 1 Index Data Output Hash sha256(hash199) hash200 sha256(hash299) hash300 Core 2 Index Data Output Hash sha256(hash299) hash300 sha256(hash399) hash400 Given some number of cores, like a modern GPU with 4000 cores, the verifier can split up the sequence of hashes and their indexes into 4000 slices, and in parallel make sure that each slice is correct from the starting hash to the last hash in the slice. If the expected time to produce the sequence is going to be: Figure 4: Verification using multiple cores Total number of hashes Hashes per second for 1 core The expected time to verify that the sequence is correct is going to be: Total number of hashes (Hashes per second per core * Number of cores available to verify) In the example in Figure 4, each core is able to verify each slice of the sequence in parallel. Since all input strings are recorded into the output, with the counter and state that they are appended to, the verifiers can replicate each slice in parallel. The red colored hashes indicate that the sequence was modified by a data insertion. 4.4 Horizontal Scaling Its possible to synchronize multiple Proof of History generators by mixing the sequence state from each generator to each other generator, and thus achieve horizontal scaling of the Proof of History generator. This scaling is done without sharding. The output of both generators is necessary to reconstruct the full order of events in the system.

The next state hash in Generator A then de- pends on the state from Generator B, so we can derive that hash1b happened sometime before hash3a. This property can be transitive, so if three gener- ators are synchronized through a single common generator A ↔B ↔C, we can trace the dependency between A and C even though they were not synchronized directly. By periodically synchronizing the generators, each generator can then handle a portion of external traffic, thus the overall system can handle a larger amount of events to track at the cost of true time accuracy due to network latencies between the generators. A global order can still be achieved by picking some deterministic function to order any events that are within the synchronization window, such as by the value of the hash itself. In Figure 5, the two generators insert each others output state and record the operation. The color change indicates that data from the peer had mod- ified the sequence. The generated hashes that are mixed into each stream are highlighted in bold. The synchronization is transitive. A ↔B ↔C There is a provable order of events between A and C through B. Scaling in this way comes at the cost of availability. 10 × 1 gbps connec- tions with availability of 0.999 would have 0.99910 = 0.99 availability. 4.5 Consistency Users are expected to be able to enforce consistency of the generated se- quence and make it resistant to attacks by inserting the last observed output of the sequence they consider valid into their input.

To prevent this attack, each client-generated Event should contain within itself the latest hash that the client observed from what it considers to be a valid sequence. So when a client creates the ”Event1” data, they should append the last hash they have observed. PoH Sequence A Index Data Output Hash hash10a Event1 = append(event1 data, hash10a) hash20a Event2 = append(event2 data, hash20a) hash30a Event3 = append(event3 data, hash30a) hash40a When the sequence is published, Event3 would be referencing hash30a, and if its not in the sequence prior to this Event, the consumers of the sequence know that its an invalid sequence. The partial reordering attack would then be limited to the number of hashes produced while the client has observed an event and when the event was entered. Clients should then be able to write software that does not assume the order is correct for the short period of hashes between the last observed and inserted hash.

The red color in the sequence indicates that the sequence has been modified by the clients data. 4.6 Overhead 4000 hashes per second would generate an additional 160 kilobytes of data, and would require access to a GPU with 4000 cores and roughly 0.25-0.75 milliseconds of time to verify. 4.7 Attacks 4.7.1 Reversal Generating a reverse order would require an attacker to start the malicious sequence after the second event. This delay should allow any non malicious peer to peer nodes to communicate about the original order. 4.7.2 Speed Having multiple generators may make deployment more resistant to attacks. One generator could be high bandwidth, and receive many events to mix into its sequence, another generator could be high speed low bandwidth that periodically mixes with the high bandwidth generator. The high speed sequence would create a secondary sequence of data that an attacker would have to reverse. 4.7.3 Long Range Attacks Long range attacks involve acquiring old discarded client Private Keys, and generating a falsified ledger [10]. Proof of History provides some protection against long range attacks. A malicious user that gains access to old private keys would have to recreate a historical record that takes as much time as the original one they are trying to forge. This would require access to a faster processor than the network is currently using, otherwise the attacker would never catch up in history length. Additionally, a single source of time allows for construction of a simpler Proof of Replication (more on that in Section 6). Since the network is de- signed so that all participants in the network will rely on a single historical record of events. PoRep and PoH together should provide a defense of both space and time against a forged ledger.

This algorithm depends on messages eventually arriving to all participating nodes within a certain timeout. 5.2 Terminology bonds Bonds are equivalent to a capital expense in Proof of Work. A miner buys hardware and electricity, and commits it to a single branch in a Proof of Work blockchain. A bond is coin that the validator commits as collateral while they are validating transactions. slashing The proposed solution to the nothing at stake problem in Proof of Stake systems [7]. When a proof of voting for a different branch is published, that branch can destroy the validators bond. This is an economic incentive designed to discourage validators from confirming multiple branches. super majority A super majority is 2 3rds of the validators weighted by their bonds. A super majority vote indicates that the network has reached consensus, and at least 3rd of the network would have had to vote maliciously for this branch to be invalid. This would put the economic cost of an attack at 1 3rd of the market cap of the coin. 5.3 Bonding A bonding transaction takes a amount of coin and moves it to a bonding account under the users identity. Coins in the bonding account cannot be spent and have to remain in the account until the user removes them. The user can only remove stale coins that have timed out. Bonds are valid after super majority of the current stakeholders have confirmed the sequence. 5.4 Voting It is anticipated that the Proof of History generator will be able to publish a signature of the state at a predefined period. Each bonded identity must confirm that signature by publishing their own signed signature of the state. The vote is a simple yes vote, without a no. If super majority of the bonded identities have voted within a timeout, then this branch would be accepted as valid. 5.5 Unbonding Missing N number of votes marks the coins as stale and no longer eligible for voting. The user can issue an unbonding transaction to remove them. N is a dynamic value based on the ratio of stale to active votes. N increases as the number of stale votes increases. In an event of a large network partition, this allows the larger branch to recover faster then the smaller branch. 5.6 Elections Election for a new PoH generator occur when the PoH generator failure is detected. The validator with the largest voting power, or highest public key address if there is a tie is picked as the new PoH generator. A super majority of confirmations are required on the new sequence. If the new leader fails before a super majority confirmations are available, the next highest validator is selected, and a new set of confirmations is required. To switch votes, a validator needs to vote at a higher PoH sequence counter, and the new vote needs to contain the votes it wants to switch. Otherwise the second vote will be slashable.

Vote switching is expected to be designed so that it can only occur at a height that does not have a super majority. Once a PoH generator is established, a Secondary can be elected to take over the transactional processing duties. If a Secondary exists, it will be considered as the next leader during a Primary failure. The platform is designed so that the Secondary becomes Primary and lower rank generators are promoted if an exception is detected or on a pre- defined schedule. 5.7 Election Triggers 5.7.1 Forked Proof of History generator PoH generators are designed with an identity that signs the generated se- quence. A fork can only occur in case the PoH generators identity has been compromised. A fork is detected because two different historical records have been published on the same PoH identity. 5.7.2 Runtime Exceptions A hardware failure or a bug, or a intentional error in the PoH generator could cause it to generate an invalid state and publish a signature of the state that does not match the local validators result. Validators will publish the correct signature via gossip and this event would trigger a new round of elections. Any validators who accept an invalid state will have their bonds slashed. 5.7.3 Network Timeouts A network timeout would trigger an election. 5.8 Slashing Slashing occurs when a validator votes two separate sequences. A proof of malicious vote will remove the bonded coins from circulation and add them to the mining pool. A vote that includes a previous vote on a contending sequence is not eligible as proof of malicious voting. Instead of slashing the bonds, this vote removes remove the currently cast vote on the contending sequence. Slashing also occurs if a vote is cast for an invalid hash generated by the PoH generator. The generator is expected to randomly generate an invalid state, which would trigger a fallback to Secondary. 5.9 Secondary Elections Secondary and lower ranked Proof of History generators can be proposed and approved. A proposal is cast on the primary generators sequence. The proposal contains a timeout, if the motion is approved by a super majority of the vote before the timeout, the Secondary is considered elected, and will take over duties as scheduled. Primary can do a soft handover to Secondary by inserting a message into the generated sequence indicating that a handover will occur, or inserting an invalid state and forcing the network to fallback to Secondary. If a Secondary is elected, and the primary fails, the Secondary will be considered as the first fallback during an election. 5.10 Availability CAP systems that deal with partitions have to pick Consistency or Avail- ability. Our approach eventually picks Availability, but because we have an objective measure of time, Consistency is picked with reasonable human timeouts. Proof of Stake verifiers lock up some amount of coin in a stake, which allows them to vote for a particular set of transactions.

Our approach eventually picks Availability, but because we have an objective measure of time, Consistency is picked with reasonable human timeouts. Proof of Stake verifiers lock up some amount of coin in a stake, which allows them to vote for a particular set of transactions. Locking up coin is a transaction that is entered into a PoH stream, just like any other transaction. To vote, a PoS verifier has to sign the hash of the state, as it was computed after processing all the transactions to a specific position in the PoH ledger. This vote is also entered as a transaction into the PoH stream. Looking at the PoH ledger, we can then infer how much time passed between each vote, and if a partition occurs, for how long each verifier has been unavailable. To deal with partitions with reasonable human timeframes, we propose a dynamic approach to unstake unavailable verifiers. When the number of verifiers is high and above 2 3, the unstaking process can be fast. The number of hashes that must be generated into the ledger is low before the unavailable verifiers stake is fully unstaked and they are no longer counted for consensus. When the number of verifiers is below 2 3rds but above 1 2, the unstaking timer is slower, requiring a larger number of hashes to be generated before the missing verifiers are unstaked. In a large partition, like a partition that is missing 1 or more of the verifiers, the unstaking process is very very slow. Transactions can still be entered into the stream, and verifiers can still vote, but full 2 3rds consensus will not be achieved until a very large amount of hashes have been generated and the unavailable verifiers have been unstaked. The difference in time for a network to regain liveness allows us as customers of the network human timeframes to pick a partition that we want to continue using. 5.11 Recovery In the system we propose, the ledger can be fully recovered from any failure. That means, anyone in the world can pick any random spot in the ledger and create a valid fork by appending newly generated hashes and transactions. If all the verifiers are missing from this fork, it would take a very very long time for any additional bonds to become valid and for this branch to achieve 3rds super majority consensus. So full recovery with zero available validators would require a very large amount of hashes to be appended to the ledger, and only after all the unavailable validators have been unstaked will any new bonds be able to validate the ledger. 5.12 Finality PoH allows verifiers of the network to observe what happened in the past with some degree of certainty of the time of those events. As the PoH generator is producing a stream of messages, all the verifiers are required to submit their signatures of the state within 500ms. This number can be reduced further depending on network conditions. Since each verification is entered into the stream, everyone in the network can validate that every verifier submitted their votes within the required timeout without actually observing the voting directly. 5.13 Attacks 5.13.1 Tragedy of Commons The PoS verifiers simply confirm the state hash generated by the PoH gen- erator. There is an economic incentive for them to do no work and simply approve every generated state hash. To avoid this condition,'},\n",

There is an economic incentive for them to do no work and simply approve every generated state hash. To avoid this condition, the PoH gener- ator should inject an invalid hash at a random interval. Any voters for this hash should be slashed. When the hash is generated, the network should immediately promote the Secondary elected PoH generator. Each verifier is required to respond within a small timeout - 500ms for example. The timeout should be set low enough that a malicious verifier has a low probability of observing another verifiers vote and getting their votes into the stream fast enough. 5.13.2 Collusion with the PoH generator A verifier that is colluding with the PoH generator would know in advance when the invalid hash is going to be produced and not vote for it. This scenario is really no different than the PoH identity having a larger verifier stake. The PoH generator still has to do all the work to produce the state hash. 5.13.3 Censorship Censorship or denial of service could occur when a 1 3rd of the bond holders refuse to validate any sequences with new bonds. The protocol can defend against this form of attack by dynamically adjusting how fast bonds become stale. In the event of a denial of service, the larger partition will be designed to fork and censor the Byzantine bond holders. The larger network will re- cover as the Byzantine bonds become stale with time. The smaller Byzantine partition would not be able to move forward for a longer period of time. The algorithm would work as follows. A majority of the network would elect a new Leader. The Leader would then censor the Byzantine bond holders from participating. Proof of History generator would have to continue generating a sequence, to prove the passage of time, until enough Byzantine bonds have become stale so the bigger network has a super majority. The rate at which bonds become stale would be dynamically based on what percentage of bonds are active. So the Byzantine minority fork of the network would have to wait much longer than the majority fork to recover a super majority. Once a super majority has been established, slashing could be used to permanently punish the Byzantine bond holders. 5.13.4 Long Range Attacks PoH provides a natural defense against long range attacks. Recovering the ledger from any point in the past would require the attacker to overtake the valid ledger in time by outpacing the speed of the PoH generator. The consensus protocol provides a second layer of defense, as any attack would have to take longer then the time it takes to unstake all the valid validators. It also creates an availability gap in the history of the ledger. When comparing two ledgers of the same height, the one with the smallest maximum partition can be objectively considered as valid. 5.13.5 ASIC Attacks Two opportunities for an ASIC attacks exist in this protocol - during parti- tion, and cheating timeouts in Finality.

For ASIC attacks during Partitions, the Rate at which bonds are unstaked is non-linear, and for networks with large partitions the rate is orders of magnitude slower then expected gains from an ASIC attack. For ASIC attacks during Finality, the vulnerability allows for byzantine validators who have a bonded stake wait for confirmations from other nodes and inject their votes with a collaborating PoH generator. The PoH gener- ator can then use its faster ASIC to generate 500ms worth of hashes in less time, and allow for network communication between PoH generator and the collaborating nodes. But, if the PoH generator is also byzantine, there is no reason why the byzantine generator wouldnt have communicated the exact counter when they expect to insert the failure. This scenario is no different than a PoH generator and all the collaborators sharing the same identity and having a single combined stake and only using 1 set of hardware. Streaming Proof of Replication 6.1 Description Filecoin proposed a version of Proof of Replication [6]. The goal of this version is to have fast and streaming verifications of Proof of Replication, which are enabled by keeping track of time in Proof of History generated sequence. Replication is not used as a consensus algorithm, but is a useful tool to account for the cost of storing the blockchain history or state at a high availability. 6.2 Algorithm As shown in Figure 7 CBC encryption encrypts each block of data in se- quence, using the previously encrypted block to XOR the input data. Each replication identity generates a key by signing a hash that has been generated Proof of History sequence. This ties the key to a replicators iden- tity, and to a specific Proof of History sequence. Only specific hashes can be selected. (See Section 6.5 on Hash Selection) The data set is fully encrypted block by block. Then to generate a proof, the key is used to seed a pseudorandom number generator that selects a random 32 bytes from each block. A merkle hash is computed with the selected PoH hash prepended to the each slice. The root is published, along with the key, and the selected hash that was generated. The replication node is required to publish another proof Figure 7: Sequential CBC encryption Figure 8: Fast Proof of Replication in N hashes as they are generated by Proof of History generator, where N is approximately 2 the time it takes to encrypt the data. The Proof of History generator will publish specific hashes for Proof of Replication at a predefined periods. The replicator node must select the next published hash for generating the proof. Again, the hash is signed, and random slices are selected from the blocks to create the merkle root. After a period of N proofs, the data is re-encrypted with a new CBC key. 6.3 Verification With N cores, each core can stream encryption for each identity. Total space required is 2blocks ∗Ncores, since the previous encrypted block is necessary to generate the next one. Each core can then be used to generate all the proofs that derived from the current'},\n",

Total space required is 2blocks ∗Ncores, since the previous encrypted block is necessary to generate the next one. Each core can then be used to generate all the proofs that derived from the current encrypted block. Total time to verify proofs is expected to be equal to the time it takes to encrypt. The proofs themselves consume few random bytes from the block, so the amount of data to hash is significantly lower then the encrypted block size. The number of replication identities that can be verified at the same time is equal to the number of available cores. Modern GPUs have 3500+ cores available to them, albeit at 1 2- 1 3 the clock speed of a CPU. 6.4 Key Rotation Without key rotation the same encrypted replication can generate cheap proofs for multiple Proof of History sequences. Keys are rotated periodically and each replication is re-encrypted with a new key that is tied to a unique Proof of History sequence. Rotation needs to be slow enough that its practical to verify replication proofs on GPU hardware, which is slower per core than CPUs. 6.5 Hash Selection Proof of History generator publishes a hash to be used by the entire network for encrypting Proofs of Replication, and for using as the pseudorandom number generator for byte selection in fast proofs. Hash is published at a periodic counter that is roughly equal to 1 2 the time it takes to encrypt the data set. Each replication identity must use the same hash, and use the signed result of the hash as the seed for byte selection, or the encryption key. The period that each replicator must provide a proof must be smaller than the encryption time. Otherwise the replicator can stream the encryption and delete it for each proof. A malicious generator could inject data into the sequence prior to this hash to generate a specific hash. This attack is discussed more in 5.13.2. 6.6 Proof Validation The Proof of History node is not expected to validate the submitted Proof of Replication proofs. It is expected to keep track of number of pending and verified proofs submitted by the replicators identity. A proof is expected to be verified when the replicator is able to sign the proof by a super majority of the validators in the network. The verifications are collected by the replicator via p2p gossip network, and submitted as one packet that contains a super majority of the validators in the network. This packet verifies all the proofs prior to a specific hash gen- erated by the Proof of History sequence, and can contain multiple replicator identities at once. 6.7 Attacks 6.7.1 Spam A malicious user could create many replicator identities and spam the net- work with bad proofs. To facilitate faster verification, nodes are required to provide the encrypted data and the entire merkle tree to the rest of the network when they request verification. The Proof of Replication that is designed in this paper allows for cheap verification of any additional proofs, as they take no additional space.

But each identity would consume 1 core of encryption time. The replication target should be set to a maximum size of readily available cores. Modern GPUs ship with 3500+ cores. 6.7.2 Partial Erasure A replicator node could attempt to partially erase some of the data to avoid storing the entire state. The number of proofs and the randomness of the seed should make this attack difficult. For example, a user storing 1 terabyte of data erases a single byte from each 1 megabyte block. A single proof that samples 1 byte out of every megabyte would have a likelihood of collision with any erased byte 1 −(1 − 1/1, 000, 0000)1,000,000 = 0.63. After 5 proofs the likelihood is 0.99. 6.7.3 Collusion with PoH generator The signed hash is expected to be used to seed the sample. If a replicator could select a specific hash in advance then the replicator could erase all bytes that are not going to be sampled. A replicator identity that is colluding with the Proof of History generator could inject a specific transaction at the end of the sequence before the pre- defined hash for random byte selection is generated. With enough cores, an attacker could generate a hash that is preferable to the replicators identity. This attack could only benefit a single replicator identity. Since all the identities have to use the same exact hash that is cryptographically signed with ECDSA (or equivalent), the resulting signature is unique for each repli- cator identity, and collision resistant. A single replicator identity would only have marginal gains. 6.7.4 Denial of Service The cost of adding an additional replicator identity is expected to be equal to the cost of storage. The cost of adding extra computational capacity to verify all the replicator identities is expected to be equal to the cost of a CPU or GPU core per replication identity. This creates an opportunity for a denial of service attack on the network by creating a large number of valid replicator identities. To limit this attack, the consensus protocol chosen for the network can select a replication target, and award the replication proofs that meet the de- sired characteristics, like availability on the network, bandwidth, geolocation etc... 6.7.5 Tragedy of Commons The PoS verifiers could simply confirm PoRep without doing any work. The economic incentives should be lined up with the PoS verifiers to do work, Figure 9: System Architecture like by splitting the mining payout between the PoS verifiers and the PoRep replication nodes. To further avoid this scenario, the PoRep verifiers can submit false proofs a small percentage of the time. They can prove the proof is false by providing the function that generated the false data. Any PoS verifier that confirmed a false proof would be slashed. System Architecture 7.1 Components 7.1.1 Leader, Proof of History generator The Leader is an elected Proof of History generator.

It consumes arbitrary user transactions and outputs a Proof of History sequence of all the transac- tions that guarantees a unique global order in the system. After each batch of transactions the Leader outputs a signature of the state that is the result of running the transactions in that order. This signature is signed with the identity of the Leader. 7.1.2 State A naive hash table indexed by the users address. Each cell contains the full users address and the memory required for this computation. For example Transaction table contains: 31 95 159 223 Ripemd of Users Public Key Account unused For a total of 32 bytes. Proof of Stake bonds table contains: 31 95 159 223 Ripemd of Users Public Key Bond Last Vote unused For a total of 64 bytes. 7.1.3 Verifier, State Replication The Verifier nodes replicate the blockchain state and provide high availability of the blockchain state. The replication target is selected by the consensus algorithm, and the validators in the consensus algorithm select and vote the Proof of Replication nodes they approve of based on off-chain defined criteria. The network could be configured with a minimum Proof of Stake bond size, and a requirement for a single replicator identity per bond. 7.1.4 Validators These nodes are consuming bandwidth from Verifiers. They are virtual nodes, and can run on the same machines as the Verifiers or the Leader, or on separate machines that are specific to the consensus algorithm configured for this network. 7.2 Network Limits Leader is expected to be able to take incoming user packets, orders them the most efficient way possible, and sequences them into a Proof of History sequence that is published to downstream Verifiers. Efficiency is based on Figure 10: Generator network limits memory access patterns of the transactions, so the transactions are ordered to minimize faults and to maximize prefetching.

This operation does not use any memory outside of the transaction message itself and can be parallelized independently. Thus throughput is expected to be limited by the number of cores available on the system. GPU based ECDSA verification servers have had experimental results of 900k operations per second [9]. 7.4 Memory Limits A naive implementation of the state as a 50% full hashtable with 32 byte en- tries for each account, would theoretically fit 10 billion accounts into 640GB. Steady state random access to this table is measured at 1.1 ∗107 writes or reads per second. Based on 2 reads and two writes per transaction, memory throughput can handle 2.75m transactions per second. This was measured on an Amazon Web Services 1TB x1.16xlarge instance. 7.5 High Performance Smart Contracts Smart contracts are a generalized form of transactions. These are programs that run on each node and modify the state. This design leverages extended Berkeley Packet Filter bytecode as fast and easy to analyze and JIT bytecode as the smart contracts language. One of its main advantages is a zero cost Foreign Function Interface. Intrinsics, or functions that are implemented on the platform directly, are callable by programs. Calling the intrinsics suspends that program and schedules the intrinsic on a high performance server. Intrinsics are batched together to execute in parallel on the GPU. In the above example, two different user programs call the same intrinsic. Each program is suspended until the batch execution of the intrinsics is Figure 11: Executing BPF programs. complete. An example intrinsic is ECDSA verification. Batching these calls to execute on the GPU can increase throughput by thousands of times. This trampoline requires no native operating system thread context switches, since the BPF bytecode has a well defined context for all the memory that it is using. eBPF backend has been included in LLVM since 2015, so any LLVM frontend language can be used to write smart contracts. Its been in the Linux kernel since 2015, and the first iterations of the bytecode have been around since 1992. A single pass can check eBPF for correctness, ascertain its runtime and memory requirements and convert it to x86 instructions.
