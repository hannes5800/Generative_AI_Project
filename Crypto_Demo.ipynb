Lenders provide liquidity by depositing cryptocurrencies in a pool contract. Simultaneously, in the same contract, the pooled funds can be borrowed by placing a collateral. Loans do not need to be individually matched, instead they rely on the pooled funds, as well as the amounts borrowed and their collateral. This enables instant loans with characteristics based on the state of the pool. A simplified scheme of the protocol is presented in figure 1 below. Figure 1: The Aave Protocol The interest rate for both borrowers and lenders is decided algorithmically: • For borrowers, it depends on the cost of money - the amount of funds available in the pool at a specific time. As funds are borrowed from the pool, the amount of funds available decreases which raises the interest rate. • For lenders, this interest rate corresponds to the earn rate, with the algorithm safeguarding a liquidity reserve to guarantee withdrawals at any time. 1.1 Basic Concepts Figure 2: Lending Pool Basics At\n",

Figure 1: The Aave Protocol The interest rate for both borrowers and lenders is decided algorithmically: • For borrowers, it depends on the cost of money - the amount of funds available in the pool at a specific time. As funds are borrowed from the pool, the amount of funds available decreases which raises the interest rate. • For lenders, this interest rate corresponds to the earn rate, with the algorithm safeguarding a liquidity reserve to guarantee withdrawals at any time. 1.1 Basic Concepts Figure 2: Lending Pool Basics At the heart of a lending pool is the concept of reserve: every pool holds reserves in multiple currencies, with the total amount in Ethereum defined as total liquidity. A reserve accepts deposits from lenders. Users can borrow these funds, granted that they lock a greater value as collateral, which backs the borrow position. Specific currencies in the pooled reserves can be configured as collateral or not for borrow positions, only low risk tokens should be considered. The amount one can borrow depends on the currencies deposited still available in the reserves. Every reserve has a specific Loan-To-Value (LTV), calculated as the weighted average of the different LTVs of the currencies composing the collateral, where the weight for each LTV is the equivalent amount of the collateral in ETH; figure 3 shows an example of parameters. Every borrow position can be opened with a stable or variable rate. Borrows have infinite duration, and there is no repayment schedule: partial or full repayments can be made anytime. Figure 3: Lending Pool Parameters In case of price fluctuations, a borrow position might be liquidated. A liquidation event happens when the price of the collateral drops below the threshold, LQ, called liquidation threshold. Reaching this ratio channels a liquida- tion bonus, which incentivizes liquidators to buy the collateral at a discounted price. Every reserve has a specific liquidation threshold, following the same approach as for the LTV. Calculation of the average liquidation threshold La Q is performed dynamically, using the weighted average of the liquidation thresholds of the collateral’s underlying assets. At any point in time, a borrow position is characterized by its health factor Hf, a function for the total col- lateral and the total borrows which determines if a loan is undercollateralized: Hf = T otalCollateralET H∗La Q T otalBorrowsET H+T otalF eesET H when Hf < 1, a loan is considered undercollateralized and can be liquidated Further details on liquidation can be found in section 3.6. 1.2 Formal Definitions Variable Description T, current times- tamp Current number of seconds defined by block.timestamp.

When a user deposits in a specific reserve, he receives a corresponding amount of aTokens, tokens that map the liquidity deposited and accrue the interests of the deposited underlying assets. Atokens are minted upon deposit, their value increases until they are burned on redeem or liquidated. Whenever a user opens a borrow position, the tokens used as collateral are locked and cannot be transferred. Further details on the tokenization are in section 3.8. 2.4 Lending Pool Configurator The LendingPoolConfigurator provides main configuration functions for LendingPool and LendingPoolCore: • Reserve initialization • Reserve configuration • Enable/disable borrowing on a reserve • Enable/disable the usage of a specific reserve as collateral. The LendingPoolConfigurator contract will be integrated in Aave Protocol governance. 2.5 Interest Rate Strategy The InterestRateStrategy contract holds the information needed to update the interest rates of a specific reserve and implements the update of the interest rates. Every reserve has a specific InterestRateStrategy contract. Specifically, within the base strategy contract DefaultReserveInterestRateStrategy the following are defined: • Base variable borrow rate Rv0 • Interest rate slope below optimal utilisation Rslope1 • Interest rate slope beyond optimal utilisation Rslope2 The current variable borrow rate is: Rv = ( Rv0 + U Uoptimal Rslope1, if U ≤Uoptimal Rv0 + Rslope1 + U−Uoptimal 1−Uoptimal Rslope2, if U > Uoptimal This interest rate model allows for calibration of key interest rates: • At U = 0, Rv = Rv0 • At U = Uoptimal, Rv = Rv0 + Rslope1 • Above Uoptimal, the interest rate rises sharply to take into account the cost of capital. The stable borrow rate follows the same model described in section 4.2. 2.6\n",

The stable borrow rate follows the same model described in section 4.2. 2.6 Governance The rights of the protocol are controlled by the LEND token. Initially, the Aave Protocol will be launched with a decentralized on-chain governance based on the DAOStack framework which will evolve to a fully autonomous protocol. On-chain implies all votes are binding: actions that follow a vote are hard-coded and must be executed. To understand the scope of the governance it’s important to make the distinction: • The Aave Protocol is bound to evolve and will allow the creation of multiple lending pools with segregated liquidity, parameters, permissions, and type of assets. • The Aave Lending Pool is the first pool of the Aave protocol until the Pool Factory Update is released and anyone can create their own pool. Within the Aave Protocol, the governance will take place at two level : 1. The Protocol’s Governance voting is weighted by LEND for decisions related to protocol parameters and upgrades of the smart contract. It can be compared to MakerDAO’s governance where stakeholders vote on current and future parameters of the protocol. 2. The Pool’s Governance where your vote is weighted based on your share of pool liquidity expressed in aTokens. The votes cover pool specific parameters such as assets used as collateral or to be borrowed. Each Pool will have its own governance, under the umbrella of the Protocol’s Governance. More details on the Governance will be published in a Governance Proposal to the community. 3 The LendingPool Contract The actions implemented within LendingPool allow users to interact with the reserve. All the actions follow this specific sequence: Figure 5: The LendingPool Contract 3.1 Deposit The deposit action is the simplest one and does not have any particular state check. The sequence of action is: Figure 6: Deposit funds 3.2 Redeem The redeem action allows users to exchange an amount of aTokens for the underlying asset. The actual amount to redeem is calculated using the aToken/underlying exchange rate Ei in section 3.8. The action is defined as follows: Figure 7: Redeem funds 3.3 Borrow The borrow action transfers to the user a specific amount of underlying asset, in exchange of a collateral that remains locked. The flow of action can be described as follows: Figure 8: Borrow funds 3.4 Repay The repay action allows the user to repay completely or partially the borrowed amount plus the origination fee and the accrued interest. Figure 9: Repay a loan 3.5 Swap Rate The swap rate action allows a user with a borrow in progress to swap between variable and stable borrow rate. Figure 10: Swap Rate 3.6 Liquidation Call The liquidationcall contract allows any external actor to purchase part of a collateral at a discounted price. In case of a liquidation event, a maximum of 50% of the loan can be liquidated, which will bring the health factor back above 1. Figure 11: Liquidation 3.7 Flash Loans The flash loan action will allow users to borrow from the reserves within a single transaction, as long as the user returns more liquidity\n",

In case of a liquidation event, a maximum of 50% of the loan can be liquidated, which will bring the health factor back above 1. Figure 11: Liquidation 3.7 Flash Loans The flash loan action will allow users to borrow from the reserves within a single transaction, as long as the user returns more liquidity that has been taken. Figure 12: Flash Loan Flash loans temporarily transfer the funds to a smart contract that respects the IFlashLoanEnabledContract.sol interface. The address of the contract is a parameter of the action. After the funds are transferred, the method executeOperation() is executed on the external contract. The contract can do whatever action is needed with the borrowed funds. After the method executeOperation() is completed, a check is performed to verify that the funds plus fee have been returned to the LendingPool contract. The fee is then accrued to the reserve, and the state of the reserve is updated. If less funds than what was borrowed have been returned to the reserve, the transaction is reverted. 3.8 Tokenization The Aave protocol implements a tokenization strategy for liquidity providers. Upon deposit, the depositor receives a corresponding amount of derivative tokens, called Aave Tokens (aTokens for short) that map 1:1 the underlying assets. The balance of aTokens of every depositor grows over time, driven by the perpetual accrual of interest of deposits. aTokens are fully ERC20 compliant. aTokens also natively implement the concept of interest rate redirection. Indeed, the value accrued over time by the borrowers’ interest rate payments is distinct from the principal value. Once there is a balance of aTokens, the accrued value can be redirected to any address, effectively splitting the balance and the generated interest. We call the continuous flow of accumulated interest over time the interest stream. To implement this tokenization strategy, Aave introduced the following concepts in the aToken contract: 1. User x balance index It x: Is the value of the reserve normalized income It x at the moment of execution of the last action by the user. 2. Principal balance Bp: Is the balance stored in the balances mapping of the ERC20 aToken contract. The principal balance gets updated on every action that the user executes on the aToken contract (deposit, redeem, transfer, liquidation, interest rate redirection) 3. Redirection address Ar: When a user decides to redirect his interest stream to another address, a new redirection address Ar is provided. If no redirection of the interest stream is performed, Ar is 0 4. Redirected Balance Bx r : Whenever a user redirects his interest stream, the balance of user redirecting is added to the redirected balance Br of the address specified by Br. Defined as follows: Bx r = P X Bp Where X is the set of users redirecting the interest stream to the user x The redirected balance decreases whenever a user x0 ∈X redeems or transfers his aTokens to another user that is not redirecting to x. 5. Current balance Bc: Is the balance returned by the balanceOf() function of the aToken contract. Defined as follows: Bx c = 0, if Bx p = 0 and Bx r = 0 Bx p + Bx r ( In Ix −1), if Ar <> 0 Bx p In Ix + Bx r ( In Ix −1), if Ar = 0 3.8.1 Limitations\n",

It’s impossible to transfer the whole balance at once: Given the perpetual accrual of the interest rate, there is no way to specify the exact amount to transfer, since the interest will keep accruing even while the transfer transaction is being confirmed. This means that having exactly 0 balance after a transfer is impossible, rather, a very small balance (dust balance) will be left to the from account executing the transfer. Note that this could have been avoided by adding specific logic to handle this particular edge case, but this would have meant adding a non standard behavior to the ERC20 transfer function, and for this reason we avoided it. Even though this is not a relevant issue, it’s important to note that is possible to completely clear the remaining balance by either 1. execute another transfer, which will most likely transfer the remaining dust balance as it would be too small to accrue interest in a reasonably short amount of time, or 2. redeem the dust balance and transfer the underlying asset. 2. Interest stream can only be redirected if there is a principal balance: This means that only accounts that have a principal balance Bp can redirect their interest. If users redeem or transfer everything, their interest redirection is reset. As a side effect of this, interest generated only by the redirected balance Br cannot be redirected. 4 Stable Rate Theory The following chapter explains how the stable rates are applied to the system and the limitations. Implementation of a fixed rate model on top of a pool is complicated. Indeed, fixed rates are hard to handle algorithmically, as the cost of borrowing money varies with market conditions and the liquidity available. There might therefore be situations (sudden market changes, bank runs ...) in which handling stable rate borrow positions would need using specific heuristics based on time or economical constraints. Following this reasoning, we identified two possible ways of handling fixed rates: 1. Imposing time constraints: fixed rates might work perfectly fine in a time constrained fashion. If a loan has a stable duration, it should survive extreme market conditions, as the borrower must repay at the end of the loan period. Unfortunately, time constrained fixed rate loans aren’t suitable for our specific use case of open ended loan. It would require a certain degree of UX friction where users would need to create and handle multiple loans with different times constraints. 2. Imposing rates constraints: An interest rate calculated at the beginning of a loan might be impacted by market conditions, keeping it from staying fixed. If the rate diverges too much from the market, it can be readjusted. This would not be a pure fixed rate, open term loan - as the rate might vary throughout the loan duration - yet users will experience actual fixed rates during specific\n",

Imposing rates constraints: An interest rate calculated at the beginning of a loan might be impacted by market conditions, keeping it from staying fixed. If the rate diverges too much from the market, it can be readjusted. This would not be a pure fixed rate, open term loan - as the rate might vary throughout the loan duration - yet users will experience actual fixed rates during specific time periods, or when there is enough liquidity available. This particular implementation has been chosen to be integrated into Aave’s Protocol under the name stable rate. 4.1 Lending Rate Oracle Figure 13: Lending Rate Oracle The first component to be integrated into the Protocol protocol is a Lending Rate Oracle, which will provide information to the contracts on the actual market rates that other lending platforms, both centralized and decentralized, are providing. The average market lending rate Mr is defined for i platforms with P i r the lending rate and P i v the borrowing volume: Mr = Pn i=1 P i rP i v Pn i=1 P iv The market rate will be updated daily, initially by Aave. 4.2 Current Stable Borrow Rate Rs The current stable borrow rate is calculated as follows: Rt s = ( Mr + U Uoptimal Rslope1, if U ≤Uoptimal Mr + Rslope1 + U−Uoptimal 1−Uoptimal Rslope2, if U > Uoptimal With: - Mr the average market lending rate. - Rslope1 the interest rate slope below Uoptimal, increases the rate as U increases. - Rslope2 the interest rate slope beyond Uoptimal, increases as the difference between U and Uoptimal increases. - U is the utilization rate. Note: Rs does NOT impact existing stable rates positions - this is applied only to new opened positions. 4.3 Limitations on Stable Rate Positions To avoid abuses on stable rate loans, the following limitations have been applied to the stable rate borrowing model: 1. Users cannot deposit as collateral more liquidity than what they are trying to borrow. Eg. a user deposits 10 million DAI collateral, tries to borrow 1 million DAI. This is to prevent the following attack vector: Given: Bs = 18%APR, Mr = 9%APR, Rl = 12%APR Users might try to artificially lower Bs to the value of Mr by depositing a huge amount of liquidity which would cause Bs to drop, then borrow from the same liquidity at a lower rate, withdraw the liquidity previously deposited to cause Bs and the liquidity rate Rl to raise again; then finally deposit the amount borrowed to earn interest on the previously borrowed funds. Although this attack can still be carried out using multiple accounts, this particular constraint makes the attack more complicated as it requires more money (and a different collateral currency). This works well in combination with the interest rate rebalancing in the next section. 2. Borrowers will only be able to borrow up to Tr of the available liquidity at the current borrow rate. So, for every specific value of Bs, there is only up to Tr of liquidity available for a single borrower. This is to avoid that a specific borrower would borrow too much available liquidity at a too competitive rate. 4.4 Stable Rate Rebalancing The last and perhaps most important constraint of the stable rate model is the rate rebalancing. This is to work around changes in market conditions or increased cost of money within the pool. The stable rate\n",

So, for every specific value of Bs, there is only up to Tr of liquidity available for a single borrower. This is to avoid that a specific borrower would borrow too much available liquidity at a too competitive rate. 4.4 Stable Rate Rebalancing The last and perhaps most important constraint of the stable rate model is the rate rebalancing. This is to work around changes in market conditions or increased cost of money within the pool. The stable rate rebalancing will happen in two specific situations: 1. Rebalancing up. The stable rate of a user x is rebalanced to the most recent value of Bs when a user could earn interest by borrowing: Bx s < Rl with Bx s the stable borrow rate of user x 2. Rebalancing down. The stable rate of a user x is rebalanced to the most recent value of Bs, if: Bx s > Bs(1 + ∆Bs) with ∆Bs a rate delta established by governance which defines the window above Bs to rebalance interest rates. If a user pays too much interest beyond that range, the rate is balanced down. 4.5 The Rebalancing Process The LendingPool contract exposes a function rebalanceStableBorrowRate(address reserve, address user) which allows to rebalance the stable rate interest of a specific user. Anybody can call this function: however, there isn’t any direct incentive for the caller to rebalance the rate of a specific user. For this reason, Aave will provide an agent that will periodically monitor all the stable rates positions and rebalance the ones that will be deemed necessary. The rebalance strategy will be decided offchain by the agent, this means that users that satisfy the rebalance conditions may not be rebalanced immediately. Since those conditions depend on the liquidity avail- able and the state of market, there might be some transitory situations in which an immediate rebalance is not needed. This does not add any element of centralization to the protocol. Even if the agent stops working, anybody can call the rebalance function of the LendingPool contract. Although there isn’t any direct incentive in doing it (“why should I do it?”) there is an indirect incentive for the ecosystem. In fact, even if the agent should cease to exist, depositors might still want to trigger a rebalance up of the lowest borrow rate positions, to increase the liquidity rate and/or force borrowers to close up their positions, increasing the available liquidity. In case of a rescale down, instead, borrowers have a direct incentive in performing a rebalance of their positions to lower the interest rate. The following flowchart explains the sequence of actions of the function rebalanceStableBorrowRate(). The compounded balance that is accumulated until the instant at which the rebalance happens, is not affected by the rebalance. Figure 14: Rebalancing 5 Conclusion The Aave Protocol relies on a lending pool model to offer high liquidity. Loans are backed by collateral and represented by aTokens, derivative tokens which accrue the interests. The parameters such as interest rate and Loan-To-Value are token specific. Aave improves Decentralized Finance’s current offering, bringing two key innovations to the lending ecosystem: • Stable Rates to help borrowers’ financial planning; • Flash Loans to borrow without collateral during a single transaction. Following the launch of the mainnet, Aave will uphold its commitment to decentralization through additional features. The Pool Factory will allow anyone to launch their own lending pool based on our smart-contracts. Governance will be on-chain with rights represented by: • The LEND\n",

       "[{'text': 'include a transaction giving themselves 25 BTC out of nowhere. Additionally, if any transaction has a higher total denomination in its inputs than in its outputs, the difference also goes to the miner as a \"transaction fee\". Incidentally, this is also the only mechanism by which BTC are issued; the genesis state contained no coins at all. ethereum.org In order to better understand the purpose of mining, let us examine what happens in the event of a malicious attacker. Since Bitcoin\\'s underlying cryptography is known to be secure, the attacker will target the one part of the Bitcoin system that is not protected by cryptography directly: the order of transactions. The attacker\\'s strategy is simple: 1. Send 100 BTC to a merchant in exchange for some product (preferably a rapid-delivery digital good) 2. Wait for the delivery of the product 3. Produce another transaction sending the same 100 BTC to himself 4. Try to convince the network that his transaction to himself was the one that came first. Once step (1) has taken place, after a few minutes some miner will include the transaction in a block, say block number 270000. After about one hour, five more blocks will have been added to the chain after that block, with each of those blocks indirectly pointing to the transaction and thus \"confirming\" it. At this point, the merchant will accept the payment as finalized and deliver the product; since we are assuming this is a digital good, delivery is instant. Now, the attacker creates another transaction sending the 100 BTC to himself. If the attacker simply releases it into the wild, the transaction will not be processed; miners will attempt to run APPLY(S,TX) and notice that TX consumes a UTXO which is no longer in the state. So instead, the attacker creates a \"fork\" of the blockchain, starting by mining another version of block 270000 pointing to the same block 269999 as a parent but with the new transaction in place of the old one. Because the block data is different, this requires redoing the proof of work. Furthermore, the attacker\\'s new version of block 270000 has a different hash, so the original blocks 270001 to 270005 do not \"point\" to it; thus, the original chain and the attacker\\'s new chain are completely separate. The rule is that in a fork the longest blockchain (ie. the one backed by the largest quantity of proof of work) is taken to be the truth, and so legitimate miners will work on the 270005 chain while the attacker alone is working on the 270000 chain. In order for the attacker to make his blockchain the longest, he would need to have more computational power than the rest of the network combined in order to catch up (hence, \"51% attack\"). ethereum.org Merkle Trees Left: it suffices to present only a small number of nodes in a Merkle tree to give a proof of the validity of a branch. Right: any attempt to change any part of the Merkle tree will eventually lead to an inconsistency somewhere up the chain. An important scalability feature of Bitcoin is that the block is stored in a multi-level data structure. The \"hash\" of a block is actually only the hash of the block header, a roughly 200-byte piece of data that contains the timestamp, nonce, previous block hash and the root hash of a data structure called the Merkle tree storing all transactions in the block. A Merkle tree is a type of binary tree, composed of a set of nodes with a large number of leaf nodes at',\n",

Currency And Issuance The Ethereum network includes its own built-in currency, ether, which serves the dual purpose of providing a primary liquidity layer to allow for efficient exchange between various types of digital assets and, more importantly, of providing a mechanism for paying transaction fees. For convenience and to avoid future argument (see the current mBTC/uBTC/satoshi debate in Bitcoin), the denominations will be pre-labelled: ● 1: wei ● 10^12: szabo ● 10^15: finney ● 10^18: ether This should be taken as an expanded version of the concept of \"dollars\" and \"cents\" or \"BTC\" and \"satoshi\". In the near future, we expect \"ether\" to be used for ordinary transactions, \"finney\" for microtransactions and \"szabo\" and \"wei\" for technical discussions around fees and protocol implementation. The issuance model will be as follows: ● Ether will be released in a currency sale at the price of 1337-2000 ether per BTC, a mechanism intended to fund the Ethereum organization and pay for development that has been used with success by a number of other cryptographic platforms. Earlier buyers will benefit from larger discounts. The BTC received from the sale will be used entirely to pay salaries and bounties to developers, researchers and projects in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. ● 0.099x the total amount sold will be allocated to early contributors who participated in development before BTC funding or certainty of funding was available, and another 0.099x will be allocated to long-term research projects. ● 0.26x the total amount sold will be allocated to miners per year forever after that point. ethereum.org Issuance Breakdown The permanent linear supply growth model reduces the risk of what some see as excessive wealth concentration in Bitcoin, and gives individuals living in present and future eras a fair chance to acquire currency units, while at the same time discouraging depreciation of ether because the \"supply growth rate\" as a percentage still tends to zero over time. We also theorize that because coins are always lost over time due to carelessness, death, etc, and coin loss can be modeled as a percentage of the total supply per year, that the total currency supply in circulation will in fact eventually stabilize at a value equal to the annual issuance divided by the loss rate (eg. at a loss rate of 1%, once the supply reaches 26X then 0.26X will be mined and 0.26X lost every year, creating an equilibrium). Group At launch After 1 year After 5 years Currency units 1.198X 1.458X 2.498X Purchasers 83.5% 68.6% 40.0% Early contributor distribution 8.26% 6.79% 3.96% Long-term endowment 8.26% 6.79% 3.96% Miners 0% 17.8% 52.0% Despite the linear currency issuance, just like with Bitcoin over time the supply growth rate nevertheless tends to zero. ethereum.org Mining Centralization The Bitcoin mining algorithm basically works by having miners compute SHA256 on slightly modified versions of the block header millions of times over and over again, until eventually one node comes up with a version whose hash is less than the target (currently around 2190). However, this mining algorithm is vulnerable to two forms of centralization. First, the mining ecosystem has come to be dominated by ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), computer chips designed for, and therefore thousands of times more efficient at, the specific task of Bitcoin mining. This means that Bitcoin mining is no longer a highly decentralized and egalitarian pursuit, requiring millions of dollars of capital to effectively participate in.',\n",

Mining Proof-of-Work. The mining proof-of- work (PoW) exists as a cryptographically secure nonce that proves beyond reasonable doubt that a particular amount of computation has been expended in the deter- mination of some token value n. It is utilised to enforce the blockchain security by giving meaning and credence to the notion of difficulty (and, by extension, total dif- ficulty). However, since mining new blocks comes with an attached reward, the proof-of-work not only functions as a method of securing confidence that the blockchain will remain canonical into the future, but also as a wealth distribution mechanism. For both reasons, there are two important goals of the proof-of-work function; firstly, it should be as accessible as possible to as many people as possible. The requirement of, or reward from, specialised and uncommon hardware should be minimised. This makes the distribution model as open as possible, and, ideally, makes the act of mining a simple swap from electricity to Ether at roughly the same rate for anyone around the world. Secondly, it should not be possible to make super-linear profits, and especially not so with a high initial barrier. Such a mechanism allows a well-funded adversary to gain a troublesome amount of the network’s total mining power and as such gives them a super-linear reward (thus skew- ing distribution in their favour) as well as reducing the network security. One plague of the Bitcoin world is ASICs. These are specialised pieces of compute hardware that exist only to do a single task. In Bitcoin’s case the task is the SHA256 hash function. While ASICs exist for a proof-of-work func- tion, both goals are placed in jeopardy. Because of this, a proof-of-work function that is ASIC-resistant (i.e. diffi- cult or economically inefficient to implement in specialised compute hardware) has been identified as the proverbial silver bullet. Two directions exist for ASIC resistance; firstly make it sequential memory-hard, i.e. engineer the function such that the determination of the nonce requires a lot of mem- ory and bandwidth such that the memory cannot be used in parallel to discover multiple nonces simultaneously. The second is to make the type of computation it would need to do general-purpose; the meaning of “specialised hard- ware” for a general-purpose task set is, naturally, general purpose hardware and as such commodity desktop com- puters are likely to be pretty close to “specialised hard- ware” for the task. For Ethereum 1.0 we have chosen the first path. More formally, the proof-of-work function takes the form of PoW: (160) m = Hm ∧ n ⩽2256 Hd with (m, n) = PoW(Hn, Hn, d) Where Hn is the new block’s header but without the nonce and mix-hash components; Hn is the nonce of the header; d is a large data set needed to compute the mix- Hash and Hd is the new block’s difficulty value (i.e. the block',\n",

Ethereum is likely to suffer a similar growth pattern, worsened by the fact that there will be many applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain instead of just a currency as is the case with Bitcoin, but ameliorated by the fact that Ethereum full nodes need to store just the state instead of the entire blockchain history. The problem with such a large blockchain size is centralization risk. If the blockchain size increases to, say, 100 TB, then the likely scenario would be that only a very small number of large businesses would run full nodes, with all regular users using light SPV nodes. In such a situation, there arises the potential concern that the full nodes could band together and all agree to cheat in some profitable fashion (eg. change the block reward, give themselves BTC). Light nodes would have no way of detecting this immediately. Of course, at least one honest full node would likely exist, and after a few hours information about the fraud would trickle out through channels like Reddit, but at that point it would be too late: it would be up to the ordinary users to organize an effort to blacklist the given blocks, a massive and likely infeasible coordination problem on a similar scale as that of pulling off a successful 51% attack. In the case of Bitcoin, this is currently a problem, but there exists a blockchain modification suggested by Peter Todd which will alleviate this issue. In the near term, Ethereum will use two additional strategies to cope with this problem. First, because of the blockchain-based mining algorithms, at least every miner will be forced to be a full node, creating a lower bound on the number of full nodes. Second and more importantly, however, we will include an intermediate state tree root in the blockchain after processing each transaction. Even if block validation is centralized, as long as one honest verifying node exists, the centralization problem can be circumvented via a verification protocol. If a miner publishes an invalid block, that block must either be badly formatted, or the state S[n] is incorrect. Since S[0] is known to be correct, there must be some first state S[i] that is incorrect where S[i-1] is correct. The verifying node would provide the index i, along with a \"proof of invalidity\" consisting of the subset of Patricia tree nodes needing to process APPLY(S[i-1],TX[i]) -> S[i]. Nodes would be able to use those nodes to run that part of the computation, and see that the S[i] generated does not match the S[i] provided. Another, more sophisticated, attack would involve the malicious miners publishing incomplete blocks, so the full information does not even exist to determine whether or not blocks are valid. The solution to this is a challenge-response protocol: verification nodes issue \"challenges\" in the form of target transaction indices, and upon receiving a node a light node treats the block as untrusted until another node, whether the miner or another verifier, provides a subset of Patricia nodes as a proof of validity. ethereum.org Putting It All Together: Decentralized Applications The contract mechanism described above allows anyone to build what is essentially a command line application run on a virtual machine that is executed by consensus across the entire network, allowing it to modify a globally accessible state as its “hard drive”. However, for most people, the command line interface that is the transaction sending mechanism is not sufficiently user-friendly to make decentralization an attractive mainstream alternative. To this end, a complete “decentralized application”',\n",

       " {'text': 'When Satoshi Nakamoto first set the Bitcoin blockchain into motion in January 2009, he was simultaneously introducing two radical and untested concepts. The first is the \"bitcoin\", a decentralized peer-to-peer online currency that maintains a value without any backing, intrinsic value or central issuer. So far, the \"bitcoin\" as a currency unit has taken up the bulk of the public attention, both in terms of the political aspects of a currency without a central bank and its extreme upward and downward volatility in price. However, there is also another, equally important, part to Satoshi\\'s grand experiment: the concept of a proof of work-based blockchain to allow for public agreement on the order of transactions. Bitcoin as an application can be described as a first-to-file system: if one entity has 50 BTC, and simultaneously sends the same 50 BTC to A and to B, only the transaction that gets confirmed first will process. There is no intrinsic way of determining from two transactions which came earlier, and for decades this stymied the development of decentralized digital currency. Satoshi\\'s blockchain was the first credible decentralized solution. And now, attention is rapidly starting to shift toward this second part of Bitcoin\\'s technology, and how the blockchain concept can be used for more than just money. Commonly cited applications include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments (\"colored coins\"), the ownership of an underlying physical device (\"smart property\"), non-fungible assets such as domain names (\"Namecoin\") as well as more advanced applications such as decentralized exchange, financial derivatives, peer-to-peer gambling and on-blockchain identity and reputation systems. Another important area of inquiry is \"smart contracts\" - systems which automatically move digital assets according to arbitrary pre-specified rules. For example, one might have a treasury contract of the form \"A can withdraw up to X currency units per day, B can withdraw up to Y per day, A and B together can withdraw anything, and A can shut off B\\'s ability to withdraw\". The logical extension of this is decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) - long-term smart contracts that contain the assets and encode the bylaws of an entire organization. What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create \"contracts\" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code. ethereum.org Ethereum: A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform.
